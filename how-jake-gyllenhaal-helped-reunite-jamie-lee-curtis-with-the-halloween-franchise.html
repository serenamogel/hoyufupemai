I think I’ve referred him as his ‘celebrity godmother.’… and he’s just been a friend for years.&nbsp;David made the wonderful movie Stronger, that Jake starred in and his company produced, and Jake called me out of the blue — it was June of last year, I remember exactly where I was — and Jake basically said, ‘My friend David would like to talk to you about something regarding Halloween’. And we spoke on the phone and he started to explain it, and I said, ‘You know what, just send it to me, and I will promise you I’ll read it.’</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Halloween-SDCC.jpg><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=410 data-injectable=true>Bet you didn’t think Jake Gyllenhaal would have anything to do with a Halloween movie, eh? And yet, here we are. Further in the interview, Jamie Lee Curtis went on to discuss how the sequel’s opening moments harken back to the John Carpenter classic from yesteryear, when Laurie Strode was just a 17-year-old babysitter in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p><p>From the opening scenes, from the first couple scenes, there’s a scene where my granddaughter is in Haddonfield, in the house where she lives with my daughter, and she’s in her bedroom, and she opens the closet door… and she pulls a bulb to illuminate what’s in the closet. And right away, I understand exactly in that moment where David was going, what they were trying to do, and really, at that moment I should have just called him at that point and said, ‘I’m on page three, yes.’ But it was very quick.</p><p data-characters=50 data-current-count=50 data-injectable=false><strong>Halloween</strong> officially returns home on October 19th.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon6ivXZ%2BurLGMoLClpJWjtaKty2afnqSgmrFuvsSupaKslWK3ornInmSlnZVisLa%2B06KqZq%2BZqbVuwMeeZKGZnKG8uLHEp2SfqpGjsKm10p5m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ho-hos-vs-little-debbie-vs-great-value-whats-the-best-swiss-roll.html><span>←</span><span>Whats the Best Swiss Roll?</span></a>
