I’m absolutely disgusted by this decision! Rachel is a f***ing queen! How dare they ! What are your thoughts on this? and why so few women??!”</p><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=512 data-injectable=true>Both Rachel and Nicole are two of the biggest names hailing from Big Brother. Rachel played in seasons 12 and 13, winning the latter. Nicole has moved into the house three times, competing in seasons 16, 18, and 22, and she was triumphant in her second appearance.</p><p data-characters=292 data-current-count=292 data-injectable=false>Janelle and Nicole <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">are in a longstanding feud</a>, so it’s not surprising to see Janelle take a shot at her in support of her friend. We last saw Rachel during The Traitors US season 1 earlier this year, and she has yet to verify Janelle’s claim about CBS “ghosting” her.</p><p data-characters=472 data-current-count=764 data-injectable=true>Also, why wasn’t Janelle cast in Reindeer Games? With CBS throwing around the term “legends” for the inaugural show’s roster, the four-time player would be a shoo-in. But, Janelle confirmed in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">comment on X</a> that she is still under contract with Peacock. This fall, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Janelle competed on The Traitors US season 2</a> — a Peacock show — which is presumably why her deal with the platform didn’t allow her to hop over to CBS this holiday season.</p><p data-characters=160 data-current-count=160 data-injectable=false>We have not received a release date for The Traitors US‘s second iteration. But, it could air in early 2024 if it follows season 1’s release window.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-competing-in-big-brother-reindeer-games data-injectable=false>Who is competing in Big Brother Reindeer Games?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=460 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=324 data-injectable=false>We published an article last week sharing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Gamervev’s” rumored Reindeer Games cast list.</a> And they were bang on.
