The Xperia Z4 will be the company's flagship smartphone for 2015, sitting alongside Sony's flagship tablet which is called the Xperia Z4 Tablet. Based on the specifications provided by Sony, it certainly looks like they've done everything possible to make it fit that role with regards to its hardware. Thankfully, Sony's launch page gives pretty much every specification one could be interested in, and I've organized them in the chart below.</p><table align=center border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=1 width=650><tbody readability=8><tr class=tgrey><td align=center colspan=7>Sony Xperia Z4</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=tlgrey>SoC</td><td align=center valign=middle><span>MSM8994 2/1.5 GHz A57/A53 Snapdragon 810</span></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=tlgrey>Memory and Storage</td><td align=center valign=middle>32GB NAND + MicroSDXC, 3GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Display</td><td align=center valign=middle>5.2" 1920x1080 IPS LCD</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=tlgrey>Cellular Connectivity</td><td align=center valign=middle><span>2G / 3G / 4G LTE (Qualcomm UE Category 7/9 LTE)</span></td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Dimensions</td><td align=center valign=middle>146 x 72 x 6.9 mm, 144g</td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=tlgrey>Camera</td><td align=center valign=middle readability=7><p>20.7 MP Sony Exmor, 1/2.3" Rear Facing, 25mm focal length<br>5.1MP Front Facing</p></td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Battery</td><td align=center valign=middle>2930 mAh</td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=tlgrey>Other Connectivity</td><td align=center valign=middle>2x2 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac + BT 4.1, microUSB2.0, NFC, GPS/GNSS</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>SIM Size</td><td align=center valign=middle>NanoSIM</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Operating System</td><td align=center valign=middle>Android 5.0 Lollipop</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The specifications for the Z4 are certainly appealing. Potential speed and thermal issues relating to Snapdragon 810 aside, the Z4 packs what is basically the best internal hardware available for smartphone manufacturers at the moment. Snapdragon 820 won't be available until the second half of this year at the absolute earliest, and so MSM8994 paired with 3GB of RAM is the fastest you'll see in an Android smartphone that isn't the Galaxy S6.</p><p>What may be notable for some is the decision to stay with a 1920x1080 LCD. Given the issues with power consumption and brightness with current 2560x1440 LCD panels, and the relatively limited improvement to sharpness at this display size, I think that staying with a 1080p display was the right decision to make with the Z4.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/9175/Xperiacolors2_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p align=center>The Xperia Z4 comes in White, Black, Copper, and Aqua Green</p><p>Design wise, the Xperia Z4 bears a great deal of similarity to its predecessor, the Xperia Z3. While it's not a full metal unibody design, it does have a metal frame surrounding the outside of the device. At 6.9mm it is as thin as the iPhone 6 which is impressive. Sony has also been able to include one of their 20.7MP sensors without introducing a camera hump, although the compromise is its 25mm focal length. Like most of Sony's recent products, the Xperia Z4 has an IP65 / IP68 rating for dust and water protection, which is something that now differentiates it from the flagship devices offered by other manufacturers.</p><p>At the moment, Sony hasn't provided any information about when an international release of the Xperia Z4 can be expected. It follows that the price is also unknown, although one can guess that it will be around the same price as this year's other flagship devices.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIZyg5RoqqimqWKur7rOrqWcnaNiwamxjLGnnqqZlnq7gA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jinni-nmixx.html><span>←</span><span>Jinni Nmixx Wiki - Age, Height, Net Worth, Family, Nationality, Boyfriend, Bio &amp;amp; News</span></a>
