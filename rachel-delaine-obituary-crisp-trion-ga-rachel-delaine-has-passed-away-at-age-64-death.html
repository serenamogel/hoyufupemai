Her life was tragically cut short due to injuries sustained in an automobile accident, leaving a void in the hearts of her family, friends, and the community. Delaine’s life was marked by her creativity, her unwavering faith, and her dedication to her family and church. Delaine, born in Joliet, Illinois, on April 15, 1956, was the daughter of the late Len Earl Sparks and Rachel Mann Sparks. She grew up in a loving family and developed a strong sense of community.</p><p>Delaine’s early years were not without their share of challenges, but she faced them with resilience and an enduring spirit that would shape her life in countless ways. In her lifetime, Delaine experienced both joy and sorrow. She bore the unimaginable loss of her daughter, Lori Annette McWhorter, and her brother, Jack Sparks. Additionally, she said goodbye to her father-in-law and mother-in-law, William “Cherry” Crisp and Pauline Crisp. These hardships only strengthened her resolve to cherish her remaining family and make the most of life. Delaine was an active member of the Pennville Church of Christ, where she found solace, purpose, and a deep sense of community. She shared her faith by serving as a Nursery class teacher and being a guiding presence for the congregation.</p><p>One of Delaine’s defining passions was her talent for carving, particularly intricate Santa Claus figures. Her carvings were renowned for their attention to detail and artistry, leaving a lasting impression on those who were fortunate to receive them as gifts. Delaine also found joy in embroidery, crochet, drawing, and all forms of crafts, constantly nurturing her creative spirit and sharing her talents with her family and friends. She had a love for thrifting and yard sales, a hobby she shared with her daughters, bonding over the thrill of discovering hidden treasures. These shared adventures created countless cherished memories and strengthened the bonds within their family.</p><p>Delaine is survived by her loving husband, Nolan, who stood by her side through the highs and lows of life. She is also survived by her daughter and son-in-law, Misty and Robert McQuese, her son-in-law, Anthony McWhorter, and her adored grandchildren, Noah McQuese, Eli McQuese, Will McWhorter, Owen McWhorter, and Ava McQuese. Her family meant everything to her, and her love for them was immeasurable. The funeral service to celebrate the life of Mrs. Rachel Delaine Crisp will be held on Saturday, October 14, 2023, at 2:00 P.M. at the Pennville Church of Christ, with Minister Robby Eversole officiating. Delaine’s final resting place will be in the West Hill Cemetery.</p><p>The pallbearers, chosen to carry Delaine to her final resting place, are Noah McQuese, Eli McQuese, Will McWhorter, Ronnie McKeehan, Jeremy Worsham, and Stanley Mann. Honorary pallbearers include Jeff and Kathy Bennett, Johnny and Kay Brimer, Mike and Janice Bowers, Leslie and Freda Shadrick, Randy and Beverly Young, and the Ladies of the Pennville Church of Christ, a testament to the impact she had on her congregation and community. For those who wish to pay their respects, Delaine will lie in state at the Pennville Church of Christ. Family and friends are welcome to visit on Saturday from 12:00 Noon until 2:00 P.M.</p><p>The passing of Mrs. Rachel Delaine Crisp leaves a void in the lives of those who knew her. However, her spirit lives on in the hearts and memories of those who were touched by her kindness, her faith, and her boundless creativity. Delaine’s legacy is one of love, resilience, and a commitment to the things that matter most in life.
