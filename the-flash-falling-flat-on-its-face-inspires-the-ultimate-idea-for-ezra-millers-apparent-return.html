The fact of the matter is, up until James Gunn truly takes the lead, DC is synonymous with overly dark (sometimes literally) tones, wooden dialogue, and tired, uninspired script writing. It’s a pale shadow <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">of its Marvel competition</a>, and The Flash <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">really didn’t change that</a>.</p><p data-characters=488 data-current-count=488 data-injectable=true>The latest, and (blessedly) last DCEU flick delivers a few things — namely, Sasha Calle’s Supergirl and Michael Keaton’s Batman — well, but everything else feels like a cheap imitation of 2021’s Spider-Man: No Way Home. The film is already considered a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">massive flop</a>, particularly by fans of the superhero genre, who’ve graced the flick with a great for DC, but abysmal for supposedly “the greatest superhero film ever made,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rotten Tomatoes score</a>.</p><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=417 data-injectable=true>Spoiler alert for anyone who’s yet to set their sights on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">utterly adequate release</a> that is The Flash: it is not the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">greatest superhero film ever made</a>. It is also not “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">magnificent</a>,” (another Gunn claim), and it’s certainly nothing overly new for the superhero world, but it’s watchable — something several Marvel-adjacent films (cough Morbius cough) don’t have in their favor.</p><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=396 data-injectable=false>Still, few people are holding their breath for another Miller outing via The Flash 2. Except for one fan, that is, who recently took to Twitter to share their stellar idea for a follow-up to the final DCEU release. They managed to hit the nail directly on the head with their Flash 2 pitch, which would see “The Flash go back in time and stop the ‘THE FLASH’ from ever releasing.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=696 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>BREAKING: ‘THE FLASH 2’ will see The Flash go back in time and stop the ‘THE FLASH’ from ever releasing <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/MZNOpPrkXW</a></p>— Le Cinéphiles (@LeCinephiles) <a href=#>June 18, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=424 data-current-count=424 data-injectable=false>Now that’s what we call meta! It would save us all so much time, and money, if Miller’s Flash simply used that new access to the Speed Force to unmake the heaping pile of mediocrity he, and the execs over at Warner Bros., shoveled into our laps with their overly-hyped film. Any far-reaching effects, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">like a new Batman actor</a>, would surely be worth it — so long as no fresh Miller clones are added to the fold.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoq6GdXZu5or%2FHZp2apJyeu6h5xaWYrWWfo3qqwNJmnZqblWK2r7%2FPoqmeq12ptaZ51KWroqWRqbJutcOemGaen6d6psbRmmSmoZyhsrO%2FjJqnqZmimru1edGeq66qnmQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./studios-and-the-amptp-are-giving-a-masterclass-in-buffoonery-latest-plan-to-deal-with-wga-strike-gets-bashed-to-the-moon-and-back.html><span>←</span><span>Studios and the AMPTP are giving a masterclass in buffoonery: Latest plan to deal with WGA str</span></a>
