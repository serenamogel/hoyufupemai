href=#>Jax Taylor</a> got down on one knee in June of 2018 to propose to his on-and-off girlfriend <a href=#>Brittany Cartwright</a> with a 3.14-carat cushion cut white diamond.</p><p>The traditional ring was a perfect fit for the Kentucky native, with a thin double halo of smaller diamonds surrounding the center stone.</p><p>The reality star spent a whopping $70,000 on the piece, later claiming the design was created with a special purpose.</p><p>One of the halos was dedicated to Brittany, while the second was created to represent Jax.</p><p>In April of 2021, the couple welcomed their first child, a <a href=#>baby boy named Cruz.</a></p><h2><strong>KATIE MALONEY & TOM SCHWARTZ</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

Pearl's Rooftop in LA.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The US Sun</h2></p><p>The TV star asked for forever with a small 2-carat pear-shaped champagne diamond set on a gold band designed by friend Kyle Chan.</p><p>The designer used 14-karat rose gold and added a pink sapphire on the band for an extra touch.</p><p>Despite its petite nature, Katie said she was “beyond happy” with the selection and&nbsp;added: “one of my and @twschwa closest friends designed this gorgeous ring and that makes it all the more special!"</p><h2><strong>LALA KENT & RANDALL EMMETT</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000700427490.jpg><p>Randall Emmett popped the question in September of 2018 while on a beautiful beach retreat.</p><p>The film producer got down on one knee with a gargantuan 6-carat diamond designed by Richie Rich from Leon Diamond in New York.</p><p>The TV personality claimed he worked with the designer for six months on the massive specimen, set on an 18K white gold ring.</p><p>The center stone was surrounded by a sparkling halo with diamonds on the band and Randall claimed the piece was worth $150,000.</p><p>However, after <a href=#>their explosive split</a>, <a href=#>Lala</a> recently went on a podcast to say that the <a href=#>ring was actually a fake</a>, that it was previously a "brown" stone, and was only worth in the "thousands."</p><h2><strong>SCHEANA & MIKE SHAY</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000704597777.jpg><p>On the second season of <a href=#>Vanderpump Rules</a> in 2013, <a href=#>Scheana</a> announced her engagement to a man from high school with whom she became reconnected.</p><p>The pair went ring shopping together in Covina, saying of the purchase: "I was specific in that I wanted a thin band with a princess cut diamond in a halo setting."</p><p>However, her hunky hubby wanted to make it a little more special so he added diamonds that her father gifted her mother when she was born.</p><p>"Knowing I have part of my mom's ring just made my engagement ring that much more special!" she said at the time.</p><p>The square stone was set with a large halo and completed with two large diamond bands for a chunky feel.</p><p>However, their romance was short-lived and the couple divorced just three years later in 2017.</p><h2><strong>SCHEANA SHAY & BROCK DAVIES</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

href=#>Brock Davies</a> presented her with a "rare" 12.74-Carat Pink Morganite ring.</p><p>The jaw-dropping jewelry also features a 14-karat white gold band adorned with 12 diamonds.</p><p>Friend of the cast Kyle Chan also designed the piece, saying: "It is a perfect rectangular cushion and this gem also possesses a rare fancy pink that reflects with insane fire.</p><p>"Morganite is all about Divine Love. Pure and simple, it is representative of unconditional love."</p><p>The pair <a href=#>welcomed their daughter Summer</a> in April of 2021, and although they had planned a Bali ceremony for November of last year, their wedding was canceled due to the pandemic.</p><h2><strong>STASSI SCHROEDER & BEAU CLARK</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000704596980.jpg><p>Actor Beau Clark proposed to <a href=#>Stassi Schroeder</a> with a family heirloom, a beautiful vintage ring that belonged to his grandfather in the 1940’s or 1950’s.</p><p>The Clark family treasure is a 3.5-carat ring featuring a European round-cut diamond surrounded by 24 smaller stones in a platinum setting.</p><p>With a price tag upwards of $100,000, Stassi said of her ring: “It’s beautiful. I feel like it’s like Cinderella’s glass slipper or something in a ring.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"It’s like, straight out of&nbsp;Downton Abbey. I knew no matter what I would love it.
