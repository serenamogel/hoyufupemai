She seemed young to me.”</p><p>Sjoberg asked the girl what school she went to, to see if it was one of the area colleges, but did not recognize the name and said it was possible it was a high school.</p><p>“And so I thought she could be younger than college age, but I had to assume for my own sanity that she was a daughter of one of his friends,” she said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Magician David Copperfield reportedly had dinner with one of Jeffery Epstein’s victims at one of the late pedophile’s homes and asked her if she knew girls were being paid to recruit other girls. <span class=credit>FREELANCE</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Epstein accuser Johanna Sjoberg, not pictured, testified that she had met Copperfield, 67, when directly asked by attorney Sigrid McCawley in a May 2016 deposition. <span class=credit>David McGlynn</span></figure><p>Sjoberg said Copperfield “did some magic tricks” at the dinner.</p><p>“Did you observe David Copperfield to be a friend of Jeffrey Epstein’s?” McCawley asked, to which the alleged victim said yes.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Follow along with everything we’ve found out about Jeffrey Epstein and his associates.</strong></a></p><p>“Did Copperfield ever discuss Jeffrey’s involvement with young girls with you?” the lawyer then asked.</p><p>“He questioned me if I was aware that girls were getting paid to find other girls,” Sjoberg said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Copperfield pictured with former President Donald Trump and Claudia Schiffer at a party in Bryant Park on Dec. 5, 1996. <span class=credit>FREELANCE</span></figure><h2 class=block-info-box__heading>What we know about the Jeffrey Epstein list of 170 associates</h2><ul><li>On Wednesday, documents were released naming 170 associates of accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. The list included Michael Jackson, <a href=#>magician David Copperfield</a>, Stephen Hawking, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and former President Bill Clinton — who an Epstein victim <a href=#>said “likes them young, referring to girls.”</a></li><li>Disgraced royal Prince Andrew, a known friend of Epstein, was named in the documents and was previously sued by Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre, who accused Andrew of sexual misconduct toward her. According to one royal family expert, the Firm <a href=#>“will stand beside” the Duke of York “no matter what.”</a></li><li>Epstein’s former attorney and friend Alan Dershowitz <a href=#>defended the late multimillionaire sex offender’s associates</a>, saying: “None of us knew about his private life that he kept so secret.” Dershowitz, who is on the list, added that no one should be automatically convicted in the court of public opinion simply for showing up in court documents.</li><li>Epstein’s brother, Mark Epstein, <a href=#>told The Post </a>that the ex-business mogul said he could have upended the 2016 election over what he knew about both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton: “Here’s a direct quote: ‘If I said what I know about both candidates, they’d have to cancel the election.’ That’s what Jeffrey told me in 2016.”</li><li>Only some of the 170 names and their relationships to Epstein have been released. The remainder of the documents will likely become public record throughout the next week.</li></ul><p><a href=#><strong>Keep up with The Post’s live blog on the revelations about Epstein’s associates revealed in the newly released documents here.</strong></a></p><p>She said he did not elaborate further including on the ages of the girls.</p><p>The Post has attempted to reach Copperfield by phone.</p><p>Other notable names that appear in the court document trove include former presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump as well as disgraced Prince Andrew.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2pmaWxfo7K4v46dmK%2BhlGKwsLzPnqmfoZWhsW6wyJ1kppmXnrBuwNGimqSrXZnCs7XNoGSaZZSeu6%2Bx0WaYrWWfo7Juu8Vmq6GdXZ28tr%2FErGSonl2fsqey0Z6wZp2gqMGmtc1o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sony-announces-the-xperia-z4.html><span>←</span><span>Sony Announces the Xperia Z4</span></a>
