He’s often seen in supporting roles, portraying police officers, or henchmen-type characters. Some of his most notable projects include “Punch-Drunk Love”, “Narcos”, and “Out of Sight”.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-net-worth-of-luis-guzman></span>The Net Worth of Luis Guzman<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As of early-2020, Luis Guzman’s net worth is estimated to be over $12 million, earned through a successful career in acting, having been in the industry for over four decades.</p><p>He’s known to be one of the more versatile actors in the industry, capable of handling serious or comedic roles depending on a production’s need.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-life-and-acting-beginnings></span>Early Life and Acting Beginnings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While Luis was born in Puerto Rico, his family later moved to the US, settling in New York City near the Lower East Side at the Village or Greenwich Village. His father worked as a repairman for televisions while his mother spent time working at a hospital. At a young age, he didn’t aspire to a career in entertainment, in fact after completing his education, he was mainly doing social work.</p><p>At the time, he wanted to look into more avenues to have a better income, so he began taking side jobs in acting. He did independent film work and theatre projects during this period, slowly developing a love for the craft. As he continued with acting, he eventually got into films, with his first notable project being “Short Eyes” which is based on the play of the same name written by Miguel Pinero. Through the early 1980s, he continued to do independent film work with a few notable projects such as “No Picnic”, “Black Rain” and “Rooftops”.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=continued-acting-work></span>Continued Acting Work<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In the 1980s, Guzman also ventured to his first few television projects, working on a couple of episodes of the show “Miami Vice”. The program aired on NBC, and became popular due to its theme of New Wave culture which was popularized at that time – the show’s popularity even led to a film adaptation down the line. He mostly did guest work as the years progressed, appearing in shows such as “NYPD Blue” and “Walker, Texas Ranger”. In 1995, he played two different characters in two episodes of “New York Undercover”. Three years later, he got his first regular role in the television series “Oz”, which aired for six seasons on HBO, staying with the show for three of those seasons.</p><p>He continued to work films as well with some of his projects during this period including “The Hard Way”, “Guilty as Sin”, “Lotto Land”, and “The Brave”. He gained a lot of attention for his performance in the film “Boogie Nights”, directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, which tells the story of a dishwasher who rises to become a star in pornographic films. The film featured an ensemble cast including Julianne Moore, Mark Wahlberg and Burt Reynolds.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-character-actor></span>The Character Actor<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Over his many years in the profession, Luis demonstrated his capability of delivering solid performances in supporting roles, such as seen in “Traffic” which is one of his many collaborations with director Steven Soderbergh.</p><p>The film follows the story of the illegal drug trade told from various perspectives, and won numerous awards including&nbsp;Best Director&nbsp;for Soderbergh at the Academy Awards. He also portrayed the assistant Jacopo in the film “The Count of Monte Cristo” which saw him work with Jim Caviezel, and is based on the classic novel of the same name written by Alexandre Dumas.</p><p>Other projects he had in the coming years included “Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events”, “Beverly Hills Chihuahua”, and “The Taking of Pelham 123”.</p><p>He had significantly lesser television work during this period, though mostly held recurring or regular roles for a season of several shows. His most notable project during the late-2000s was the series “How to Make it In America”, in which his comedic performance helped him achieve a NAMIC Vision Award. The show like his other projects also aired on HBO, and tells the story of two people who try to make it big in the fashion industry.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=recent-projects></span>Recent Projects<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In recent years, Guzman has been busy expanding his repertoire, doing voice acting work for several video games such as “Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories”.</p><p>He’s also appeared in several music videos, including “Esta Rico” by Marc Anthony and Will Smith. On television, he was one of the regular cast members of the show “Code Black”, a medical series which aired on CBS for three seasons before its cancellation. He also had a prominent role in the inaugural season of “Narcos”, during its depiction of the reign of Pablo Escobar in the illegal drug trade.</p><p>He shows no sign of taking a break from work any time soon, as he’s been seen in projects such as “The Last Stand”, “We’re the Millers”, and “The Padre”.</p><p>He’s also done voice work in animated films such as “Turbo” and “Henry & Me” in which he portrayed Lefty Gomez. He’s also done a bit of production work and is credited as the executive producer of some of the films he’s starred in. Some of his most recent production efforts include “Puerto Ricans in Paris” and “Aztec Warrior” which starred Terry Crews and Nadine Velazquez.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=personal-life></span>Personal Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Luis married Angelita Galarza in 1985, and they have five children together.</p><p>He prefers to keep his family life away from the media and rarely talks about his marriage. The family resides mainly in Sutton, Vermont, with Luis preferring to settle in a smaller area.</p><p>He’s also very active in terms of politics, and has been highly critical during the reign of Ricky Nevares, who was the governor of Puerto Rico involved in the&nbsp;Telegramgate scandal&nbsp;which revealed major corruption with the country’s government. He was also highly supportive of Senator Bernie Sanders during his bid for the presidential election in 2016.</p><h2 class=tabtitle><span class=ez-toc-section id=general-info></span>General Info<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Luis Guzmán</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$14 million</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>$14 million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>August 28, 1956</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.71&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Film producer, Social Worker, Voice Actor</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>City College of New York</td></tr></table><h2 class=tabtitle><span class=ez-toc-section id=family></span>Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Angelita Galarza-Guzman</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Margarita Briggs-Guzman, Clare Briggs-Guzman, Cemi Briggs-Guzman, Yemaya Briggs-Guzman, Luna Briggs-Guzman, Yoruba Briggs-Guzman, Jace O’ Flynn Guzman</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Benjamin Cardona, Rosa Cardona</td></tr></table><h2 class=tabtitle><span class=ez-toc-section id=accomplishments></span>Accomplishments<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table><tr><td>Awards</td><td>Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture, Florida Film Critics Circle Award for Best Cast</td></tr><tr><td>Nominations</td><td>Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male, ALMA Award for Favorite Movie Actor</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>Journey 2: The Mysterious Island, Puerto Ricans in Paris, Boogie Nights, Carlito’s Way, The Count of Monte Cristo, The Last Stand, The Taking of Pelham 123, Magnolia, Keanu, Punch-Drunk Love, Turbo, The Bone Collector, Anger Management, Carlito’s Way: Rise to Power, Traffic, We’re the Millers, In th…</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>Code Black, How to Make It in America, John from Cincinnati, House of Buggin’, I Love Toys, I Love the ’80s Strikes Back, I Love the ’90s: Part Deux, I Love the ’70s: Volume 2, Luis</td></tr></table><h2 class=tabtitle><span class=ez-toc-section id=social-profile-links></span>Social profile links<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table><tr><td>Twitter</td><td>http://www.twitter.com/iamluisguzman</td></tr><tr><td>Instagram</td><td>http://www.instagram.com/loueyfromthehood</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>http://imdb.com/name/nm0350079</td></tr></table><h2 class=tabtitle><span class=ez-toc-section id=marks></span>Marks<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table class=trademarks><tr><th>#</th><th>Marks / Signs</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>He often plays a cop or a villains’ sidekick</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>His wolf-man like face</td></tr></table><h2 class=tabtitle><span class=ez-toc-section id=quotes></span>Quotes<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table class=quotes><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>[on working as a Nurse on Code Black (2015)] “You’re not showing up to do 10 hours as an actor. You’re showing up to do 12 hours as a doctor, as a nurse.”</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>[on working as a Nurse on Code Black (2015)] “You’re showing up to do a real shift,”</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>[on the expectations on Code Black (2015)] “I’ve been doing this for a long time but this show is different in that in this show you’re showing up to do a real shift.”</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>[his perception of Code Black (2015)] It’s very realistic. I think people are going to be drawn to that.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>(On landing his role in Oz (1997)) It’s funny, because the first year Oz came on the air, so many of my friends were telling me about it, “You’ve gotta watch this show, you’ve gotta watch this show.” So one of my friends sent me three episodes of it, and I watched it. I called my agent and I said, “Bro, you’ve got to get me on this show.” My agent tells me, “Nobody’s getting paid to do this show.” I said, “I don’t care that nobody’s getting paid, it’s a great show, man.” I called Tom Fontana and I said, “Tom, please, put me on the show, [give me] anything.” I did three years of it, and it was a great experience. We had the best cast in the world. Everybody was really working together. The story lines that were coming out were mind-boggling. It was like a quilt: You got the white supremacist, the Muslim, the Latinos, the Italians, the gays, you got this, you got that, you got the prison guards. It made for such great storytelling. It was like a prison soap opera that was so well-conceived and put together. And again it was one of those things that I was fortunate to have found.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>(On Boogie Nights (1997)) _Paul Thomas Anderson_ sent me that script. It sat in my office for six months. One day I walk in and I go, “I’ve got to clean this place up, what a mess.” I had piles and piles of scripts and papers. I got to the bottom of the pile and I said, “Oh, wow, Boogie Nights. All right, let me check it out.” Because I’m sorting and seeing what I’m throwing away and what’s going into the fireplace. I sat down and I started to read the script. I kept reading it, and I read the whole thing in one reading. I was blown away at how well the story was written, how eloquent it was. It was an incredible story. I called him up, and I said, “Dude, I just read your script. Blew me away!” Because he captured that era so well, the characters were so amazingly well-written, the whole storyline and all that stuff. So I had this conversation with him, and I think I was in my mid-30s, so I ask him, “Dude, how old are you?” And he says [Makes mumbling noise.] and I go, “44? Oh, okay.” And he says, “No, no, I’m 24.” There was a silence on the phone, and he goes, “You there? You okay?” I go, “Dude, 24 years old, and you captured that era so well?” I said, “Oh my goodness.” So I signed onto it. It was probably one of the most amazing experiences, shooting that movie, especially that whole opening sequence. It’s just one long camera take. Just seeing Paul’s passion for it and everything, and all the cats who were involved in it. Of course, I didn’t know who half of the people were that I was working with, I might have seen this guy or this girl, but for the most part, I was just blended into this awesome group of people. It was an amazing experience, he shot it so well. We became so tight on that movie. He showed me a rough cut of that movie. I’m walking out, and he goes, “What do you think?” I go, “Oh, I don’t know, man, I don’t know, I’ve got to think about it.” Because when I first saw it, it was shocking. It blew me away. It messed up my senses. After a couple of days, I said, “Bro, you got an amazing movie here.” That’s a tribute to Paul, because when you see a movie like that, it takes a while to sink in. You’ve really got to process it. You know you just saw something special. Sometimes you see a movie and you say, “It’s great.” But this movie had so many different avenues going on, and so many different story lines and things just weaving out of each other. And my question to Paul was, “Are they gonna let you release this movie, bro?” Because it was shocking. But it was shocking because there was so much truthfulness. This is the industry. But it wasn’t a movie about pornography. It was a movie about the people that make those movies, and their story, and the stuff that they go through. I was so proud of him, of the cast of that movie and of how well that movie turned out. I thought that movie should have gotten an Academy Award nomination, because it was one of the best movies to have come around of that genre, maybe the only one of its kind.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>(On The Brave) You know, that movie was never released. It was Johnny [Depp]’s first stab at directing. I play his main nemesis in that movie. I love Johnny. Johnny’s a great guy. I had fun working side-by-side with him. It’s a struggle, man. It’s a struggle to be as young as he was and be directing a movie like that and just trying to make it all work. He was trying his own path to it. [It was] the first movie I had ever been in with Marlon Brando, except I never got to meet Marlon on the set. But just knowing I got to work on a movie with one of my idols was awesome. It was work, you know? I just put myself into that role, being the most badass motherfucker that I could be. That’s how I approach it. The thing about some of these characters, it’s like you’ve got to really fucking go for it. You have to strip yourself of everything and just go for it. Whether it’s being a cop, whether it’s being somebody’s sidekick, there are certain elements to those characters that you’ve got to bring all this stuff to the table. It’s something I’m really proud of. I don’t think I’ve played the same role twice in a movie. When I show up it’s, “Okay, it’s a fresh slate.” To my credit, I grew up on the Lower East Side. Where I grew up, it looked like a bomb hit that neighborhood. I grew up with every single element, good and bad-you want to talk about the good, the bad, and the ugly, I got all of that, so my life was always my reference to different characters that I’ve played. So when I did that movie with Johnny, The Brave, it was a guy [who] just didn’t give a fuck who he was. He just went for it, “I’m badder than you.” I don’t think about that, I just do it.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>(On Carlito’s Way (1993) & Carlito’s Way: Rise to Power (2005)) Well, I don’t think you can really compare (them), because one, you’re working with Sean Penn and Al Pacino, and it was a different kind of movie than the prequel-and mind you, I play two different characters. In Carlito’s Way, I play Pachanga, which was Pacino’s main sidekick. That for me was such a great movie, because it captured that quote-unquote “criminal element” of someone just trying to make it [who] gets sucked right back into it, and you can’t trust nobody. Johnny Leguizamo was in there too, and it was a great story about a guy from the neighborhood who just couldn’t get out of it. Then in the prequel, Jay Hernandez played the young Carlito, and I was this guy, Nacho Reyes, who was this Cuban guy who was into Santería and is an assassin and a coke-head, but it was a different movie. I don’t think it was nowhere near the level that Carlito’s Way was. But for me, anyway, it was just one of those roles where I saturated myself with it and just went for it. It’s like jumping off a building without a parachute, but I’m having enough confidence that I’m going to land.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>(On making Q&A) I had done a movie for Sidney Lumet called Family Business (1989). I had only one scene in that movie, and my scene was with Dustin Hoffman. In that one scene, I grew up like, 10 years in the business. Dustin taught me a lot. I learned a lot about my instincts. Sidney Lumet came up to me and said, “Look, I’m putting another movie together, and there might be a little something for you.” At the time I was doing one, two, maybe three days’ worth of work on movies. When he told me that, I thought, “Oh man, maybe I’ll get four days this time.” And it ended up being that role. I absolutely consumed myself in it. I worked with some great actors-Charlie Dutton and Armand Assante, Nick Nolte, and Timothy Hutton, working with the genius of Sidney Lumet. I grew up a lot. I learned a lot. I always showed up prepared, but always with the intention of, “What can I learn today? When I did Q&A, I used to do ride-along, where you ride in the squad car and you actually go out for eight hours. You sit in the squad car and you hear everything that goes on in the squad car, what comes in over the talkie. You go into different situations, and you experience them. So this way when you show up to a movie set, you’re not acting a cop, but you’re living a cop, because you understand some of the psychology involved, the lingo, the attitude, the personality, how you deal with people, how people deal with you, how people react to you, how you react to people. For me, it was absolutely a learning experience, so I benefited from that, because when I show up on set, I know what my attitude is. It’s not something I have to make up. I experienced it, I lived it.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>(On getting involved in Nothing Like the Holidays (2008)) I got a call from Freddy [Rodríguez]. He said, “I’m doing this movie in Chicago, and I’d like to know if you would like to do a cameo in it.” I go, “Yeah, bro, anything to support you, you’re a good buddy of mine.” So they sent me the scene-originally it was this scene involving the priest. So I read it, and then we got into a whole conversation, and I said, “It’s okay, but I think when a priest shows up to somebody’s house, there needs to be more of an impact there. So we need to just beef up the scene, make it worth my while.” We talked and I gave him my notes. About a week later, I get a phone call. They said, “Hey man, would you mind checking out the part of Johnny?” I go, “Oh my God, this is right down my alley.” Everybody has a cousin Johnny in their family. Everyone has that older cousin who wishes he were still young, and he looks out for all the younger siblings and cousins and stuff like that. I just dug the whole premise of the script, and they were compiling a really great cast of actors. I said, “Oh man, I’d love to be a part of this.” I showed up and my whole thing was, “I want to be a part of this family.” Pretty much that’s how I approached it, and I got so much love from it, and gave so much love back to it. It’s one of those projects that I was totally proud of. Not just because I was making a Latin movie about a Latin family, but because I was making a good movie, a good story, a universal story that could apply to any family in any corner of this country or the world, for that matter, because we always come together, the family at least once a year, or once every couple of years.</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>I’ve become, like, this farmer. I live on the top of a mountain and I look out at the birds fighting over the bird table instead of guys fighting over a parking space. It’s about as far from my old neighborhood as you can get. But you know what they say: you can take the kid out of the Lower East Side but you can’t take the Lower East Side out of the kid.</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Never thought about pursuing acting as a career. Back then we were mainly performing at block parties. It was a labor of love and it was a lot of fun. The best I thought I could do was maybe make a few extra bucks on the side. All I really wanted was to earn enough to buy myself a used car so I could drive out to Orchard Beach at the weekend. This whole thing is a complete fluke.</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Leading men crash and burn. Character actors are around forever.</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>My all time favorite actor is Marlon Brando. I admired how effortless and how real he was in his performance in On the Waterfront (1954).” To me, he wasn’t acting. He was living the role. And that’s what I admire about good acting. It’s real.</td></tr></table><h2 class=tabtitle><span class=ez-toc-section id=facts></span>Facts<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table class=interesting_facts><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Has been in two movies with the word “way” in the title: The Cowboy Way (1994) and Carlito’s Way (1993).</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>In the show Community, he is portrayed as a former student of Greendale.
