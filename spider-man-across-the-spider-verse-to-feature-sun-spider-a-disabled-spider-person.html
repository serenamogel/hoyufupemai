We’ve seen a whole host of spider-themed superheroes, ranging from Spider-Woman to Spider-Man 2099, but none are quite as significant as Sun-Spider, a disabled Spider-Person created by comics editor, writer, and designer Dayn Broder (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">@dayn_does_comix</a>) and greenlit by editors Kaeden McGahey and Nick Lowe (see Editor’s Note below).</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=478 data-current-count=478 data-injectable=true>But who exactly is Sun-Spider? Well, she hails from Earth-20023 and, like her creator, lives with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, a condition that affects her joints and connective tissue. Due to her disability, Sun-Spider — also known as Charlotte Webber — uses a wheelchair and crutches as mobility aids. As Sun-Spider, her crutches are equipped with web-shooters. If that isn’t the coolest, most inventive and thought-out character design ever, we don’t know what is.</p><p data-characters=359 data-current-count=359 data-injectable=false>There isn’t much of a backstory for Sun-Spider, who made her debut in Black, queer, and disabled comic book writer Tee Franklin’s Edge of Spider-Verse #4, but we can assume — and this is a long shot — that she was bitten by a radioactive spider. Regardless, she’s become the first disabled Spider-Person to feature in her own comic book.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=659 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Well, hell, didn’t see this coming.

Bang! Kill. Tour&nbsp;and&nbsp;Harley Quinn: The Animated Series: Legion of Bats! under the DC Comics label, but she also published Edge of Spider-Verse #4 for Marvel Comics. Considering her brief appearance in Edge of Spider-Verse #4, Sun-Spider was never treated with the same respect as some of her spider-peers and she was subsequently overshadowed for the likes of more consistent characters. After it was revealed that Sun-Spider would be appearing in Across the Spider-Verse, Franklin opened up on Twitter about her struggles with making Charlotte Webber known to the world and insisting that she be included.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>I went through fucking HELL for Sun-Spider, that was honestly one of the lowest moments for me.</p><p>NGL, I feel lowkey vindicated.</p>— TEE “EXHAUSTED” FRANKLIN (@MizTeeFranklin) <a href=#>December 20, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Shoutout to the producers and directors for including disabled representation in <a href=#>#AcrossTheSpiderVerse</a> <a href=#>#SunSpider</a> <a href=#>https://t.co/C2JlUdbhCZ</a></p>— TEE “EXHAUSTED” FRANKLIN (@MizTeeFranklin) <a href=#>December 20, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=234 data-current-count=234 data-injectable=false>And it looks like — apart from some naysayers — Sun-Spider has been well-received amongst fans. The audience, for one, can’t wait to see Sun-Spider in action. As for Franklin and Dayn, their hard work is clearly paying off.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=534 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>well good MORNING TO US!!!!!! <a href=#>https://t.co/bQElxB5IPx</a></p>— Dayn, who does comics (@dayn_does_comix) <a href=#>December 20, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=353 data-injectable=false>It wasn’t always like that, though. When Sun-Spider was first introduced, many Marvel fans had a sour reaction to her inclusion. Thankfully, that’s only a small majority of the fans, since a lot of disabled Marvel nuts are praising Franklin for fighting to get Sun-Spider — a representation of disabled excellence — up on the big screen.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=653 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>As soon as I saw Sun Spider on the ATSV poster I almost cried, Sun Spider is my favorite and it makes me so happy to see my disability represented in media as someone with EDS.
