From surprising smooches between cast members to an unexpected Green Goblin appearing on the red carpet — we had it all.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=338 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>As all of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">our favorite celebrities were walking down</a> the coveted carpet, one glob of green immediately caught everyone’s eye. Someone — other than Willem Dafoe — was dressed up as a weird green goblin. In fact, we could easily mistake this sudden appearance as part of the Teen Choice Awards, but no — it really was the Emmys.</p><p data-characters=188 data-current-count=526 data-injectable=true>For many unaware fans watching the award ceremony, the Green Goblin might have come off as some sort of marketing strategy from Marvel, but no — this was actually someone’s outfit.</p><h2 id=h-who-was-the-green-goblin-at-the-emmys-2024 data-injectable=false>Who was the Green Goblin at the Emmys 2024?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/RuPauls-Emmys-2024.jpg><p data-characters=365 data-current-count=665 data-injectable=true>The decision to dress like a Green Goblin came from none other than reality star Princess Poppy, known and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">loved for her participation in RuPaul’s Drag Race</a>. This bold choice to dress a miscellaneous green creature sprang from Poppy’s desire to stand out and rebel against the conventional attire expected of attendees, as she told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a>.</p><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=354 data-injectable=false>“I wanted to do the exact opposite of what is expected of you when you go to an event like this. I wanted to take decorum and turn it on its head,” Poppy expressed while on the red carpet.”Mainly I wanted to be a troll-slash-hag. I wanted to be so shocking that you just have to turn and look at me — in the worst way possible.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=654 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Princess Poppy (@poppyprincesspoppy)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=412 data-current-count=412 data-injectable=true>At the same time, it also led to gazillions of fans’ curiosity, wondering if it was indeed Willem Dafoe — who recently celebrated his first star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">announcing his reprisal of the Green Goblin</a>. After all, in Hollywood, anything can happen. However, given that the Green Goblin at the Emmys wasn’t the Marvel character we know, the likelihood of it being Dafoe was low.</p><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=353 data-injectable=false>This is partly because it wasn’t a goblin at all. The green head-to-toe ensemble included references to several iconic green figures, including Roz from Monsters Inc., the witch from the 1985 Tom Cruise movie Legend, and even Jabba the Hutt. It was a fun way to juggle various elements to portray Poppy’s desire to become a hag-troll hybrid.</p><p data-characters=167 data-current-count=520 data-injectable=false>As much as we would’ve loved to see DaFoe as Green Goblin at such a high-end event, we’re also quite happy knowing it was the iconic Queen, Princess Poppy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMsJisZaSdsm6z0Z6cp2WXpK%2Bttc1mmK1lpJ2ybn6Pa2tmnZ2ixrR5wKebZq%2BYrnq4rdKnq2ahpGLEqrjLnqRmnJGbvKZ7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./this-is-how-long-it-would-take-to-drive-to-space.html><span>←</span><span>This Is How Long It Would Take To Drive To Space</span></a>
