And if you want to shop like him, we’re here to help. We’ve rounded up all of the foods and drinks he’s recommended in <a href=#>Sporked’s Mythical Kitchen Picks series</a>, so you can use this article as your grocery list the next time you want to cosplay as Josh at home.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-hebrew-national-hot-dogs><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Hebrew National Hot Dogs</a></strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/MK-PICKS-COOKOUT_JOSH-HOT-DOGS_INSETS-1170x658.jpg><p>If you ever want Josh to really start talking (not that he needs much encouragement), just ask him about his favorite hot dog. He stands firmly behind Hebrew National saying that it is&nbsp; “the greatest tasting hot dog” you can buy. The 100% all-beef dog is seasoned perfectly, just fatty enough, and so good you won’t even miss the snap of a natural casing.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-arizona-gunslinger-jalapeno-hot-sauce><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Arizona Gunslinger Jalapeno Hot Sauce</a></strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/MK-PICKS_JOSH-HOT-SAUCE_INSET-1170x658.jpg><p>Josh and his tongue of steel may now compete in the <a href=# rel=noopener>world’s spiciest cooking challenge</a>, but at home his go-to hot sauce is not made with Carolina reaper peppers or even habaneros. It’s a straight up jalapeno hot sauce made simply with vinegar, salt, and peppers. He likens it to Tabasco but says it’s better because of the texture. “Gunslinger leaves the pepper pulp in the sauce which gives it this beautiful and wholesome texture,” he says. “It coats the palate like a buttery Chardonnay, except it tastes way better when poured onto a burrito than Chardonnay does.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-haagen-dasz-strawberry-butter-cookie-cone><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Häagen-Dasz Strawberry Butter Cookie Cone</a></strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MK-PICKS_JOSH-END-OF-SUMMER-FAV_INSET-1170x658.jpg><p>This is the grown-up version of a classic Drumsticks sundae cone. “No more sugar cone that gets weirdly soggy and freezer burnt after months of absorbing moisture in the freezer,” Josh says. Instead, the short crust cookie cone stays crisp and buttery. And Josh loves how the vanilla ice cream (Häagen-Dasz makes some of the <a href=#>best vanilla ice cream</a>) contacts with the strawberry “goo.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-trader-joe-s-pumpkin-spice-coffee><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Trader Joe’s Pumpkin Spice Coffee</a></strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MK-PICKS_FALL-FAVORITES-JOSH_INSET-1170x658.jpg><p>Josh drinks a lot of coffee. But he’s definitely not a coffee snob. “The nuances of Ethiopian beans and light roasts and ristretto pulls are absolutely beyond me,” he says. But when fall rolls around, he likes his coffee to taste like cinnamon and nutmeg and cloves—aka pumpkin spice. And his pumpkin spice coffee of choice comes from Trader Joe’s&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-olipop-classic-root-beer><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Olipop Classic Root Beer</a></strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MK-PICKS_JOSH-HEALTHY-SODA_INSET-1170x658.jpg><p>“I can’t stop drinking this stuff,” Josh says. Not only does he appreciate the prebiotic soda’s 9 grams of fiber and lower calories, he also genuinely loves the flavor. He’s a fan of Olipop in general, but the Classic Root Beer continues to be his number one.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-guerrero-riquisimas-burrito-grande-tortillas><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Guerrero Riquisimas Burrito Grande Tortillas</a></strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MK-PICKS_JOSH-TORTILLAS_INSET-1170x658.jpg><p>This is the only tortilla brand Josh uses when he makes burritos. He describes them as “large, light, and flexible as those foil-looking blanket things that they wrap hyperthermia victims and marathon runners in.” Most importantly, it has that translucent quality so you can just start to see the filling from the outside. “If you want to step up your home burrito game, and ultimately improve your life, you need to hop on the Guerrero Riquisimas Burrito Grande train,” he says.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKKfqLVuv8KhnKudomKzosLOq6CtnV2bvLCw0mg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./johnny-carson.html><span>←</span><span>Johnny Carson - Show, Death &amp;amp; Children</span></a>
