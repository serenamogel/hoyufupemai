According to the hypothesis, Noonan eventually passed away, the plane floated off the reef, and Earhart was left alone on the island.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/amelia-.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>An experiment to see what the crabs might have done to poor Earhart was conducted in 2007 by a team of scientists.

When they had all they could find, the crabs hauled it down to their underground dens, where they ate the flesh off the bones.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>King believes Earhart’s death as a castaway on the island is likely.

Yet, in the end, Amelia Earhart sadly perished while attempting.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Several explanations for Amelia Earhart’s demise have surfaced in the years since. According to some, Earhart and Noonan allegedly temporarily survived as castaways on another uninhabited island.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Others think the Japanese may have captured them. And according to at least one theory, Earhart and Noonan were spies who managed to return alive to the United States, where they spent the remainder of their lives using false identities. Her being eaten by crabs is the most intriguing possibility.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The journey that ended with Amelia Earhart’s death had a difficult beginning. According to NASA, she originally intended to travel from east to west.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>On March 17, 1937, she set out for Honolulu, Hawaii, from Oakland, California. Three additional crew members, navigator Fred Noonan, captain Harry Manning, and stunt pilot Paul Mantz, were scheduled to fly with her.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Amelia and Noonan, however, never made it there.</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Also Read</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Tyler Lawrence Murder Case: Csean Skerritt Arrested In Connection With Lawrence’s Death</span></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmispqi1sMPSrZirq16YvK57wKacpaGRYrKivseaqa1lk6SwsLrUrWScqpGXere1w56mZq%2BRqHq0tMRmnJqslaN8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sandisk-ultra-plus-ssd-review-256gb.html><span>←</span><span>SanDisk Ultra Plus SSD Review (256GB)</span></a>
