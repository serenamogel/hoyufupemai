The victim of a shark attack and death in the Bahamas has been identified as Lauren Erickson Van Wart, who was 44 years old and from Lowell, Massachusetts.
The Bahamas Police Department was the one that successfully made this identification.
It was meant to be a wonderful vacation for a devoted couple from Lowell, but it turned out to be a devastating one when the wife, who was 44 years old, was murdered by a shark while paddle surfing approximately three quarters of a mile off the beach at the Sandals resort."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
