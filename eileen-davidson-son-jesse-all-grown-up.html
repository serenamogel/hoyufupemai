Exhibit A: Jesse's <a href=#>Instagram</a> account names running as one of his biggest passions.&nbsp;</p><p>As noted by <a href=#>Athletic Net</a>, Jesse has been running since his high school days. And, as proud mama Eileen Davidson revealed in an <a href=#>Instagram</a> post back in 2021, he was quite the wunderkind in that department, too, as the record holder for his high school's 800-meter race.&nbsp;A few years on, he's continued down that path as <a href=#>a college athlete</a>. However, while he's clearly a gifted runner, in a May 2023 <a href=#>Instagram</a> post, he got real about feeling like he'd had some setbacks along the way. "Although it may seem that from the outside I am always positive and motivated, I found it hard to stay positive during the times where my goals would not be achieved over a certain time," he shared in the caption.&nbsp;</p><p>Even with the setbacks, it's safe to say the youngest of the Van Patten siblings is committed to his passion. Case in point: In one <a href=#>Instagram</a> post, he shared that much of his 2023 summer vacation was spent training, from runs in the rain to early morning treadmill sessions after a concert.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxjZYR6g46eoKWdlaN6pa3Vopusp55iwLC6jKOcrKuVYq6tuIygqaivnmLCsXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tati-westbrook-net-worth-208119.html><span>←</span><span>Tati Westbrook Net Worth</span></a>
