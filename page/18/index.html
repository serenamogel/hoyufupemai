From a critical point of view, however, the two films are quite uneven. I'd be interested in learning which one director Ousmane Sembene made first. The short, "Borom Sarret" has the stark and lean simplicity of a story by Babel. But the feature, "Black Girl," is a slow and pedestrian affair that shows little of the same poetry in its filming.
"Borom Sarret" is about a cartman, hard pressed for cash, who during a typical day makes no money, performs a few simply human services, worries about his horse, exhibits a callousness that seems quite reasonable and finally loses his cart after breaking a law left over from colonialism.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Hurricane G Age, Height, Parents, Cause Of Death, Husband, Children, Net Worth</h2><time>Aug 9, 2024</time>
