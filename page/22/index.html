It’s also a personal cinematic endeavor as opposed to a historical crash course in the vein of “Cries From Syria,” another superb documentary on the subject, but one with different ambitions.

He adds three other significant roles, in order to flesh out actions that the play described in prose. This is too literal. His actors do an effective job with their soliloquies, but the audience is tugged back and forth between the stylized speech and the straight dramatic material.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Katie Poulter: Ian Poulter Biography, Wife, Age, Wikipedia, Instagram, Net Worth</h2><time>Jul 26, 2024</time>
