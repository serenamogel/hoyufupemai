<a href=../../dont-expect-kingpin-appear-netflixs-punisher-series.html></a>
Recommended Videos Perhaps one of the greatest and indeed surprising encounters in Daredevil season 2 was the moment when Jon Bernthal‚Äôs Frank Castle was thrown in jail, only to strike up an unlikely alliance with Kingpin, the criminal overlord played close to perfection by&nbsp;Vincent D‚ÄôOnofrio.
That nail-biting tension culminated in a good old-fashioned brawl between the two villains, leading to The Punisher escaping back onto the streets of Hell‚Äôs Kitchen. It‚Äôs here that we expect Netflix‚Äôs planned solo series to kick into gear, but given the overwhelmingly positive reaction to Frank Castle‚Äôs clash with Kingpin, one might assume that the Powers That Be at Marvel and Netflix would find a workaround to ensure&nbsp;Vincent D‚ÄôOnofrio reprises as the mob boss later this year.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Stars You Forgot Were in Burlesque</h2><time>Sep 8, 2024</time>

What‚Äôs not surprising is the subtlety Colin Firth finds in playing Eric Lomax, whose autobiography inspired "The Railway Man." (Frank Cottrell Boyce and Andy Paterson co-wrote the screenplay.) Playing Lomax as a shell of his former self decades after his imprisonment, Firth is both quietly distracted and fitfully tormented. Throughout his career, Firth repeatedly has proven himself to be a master at steadily revealing his characters, and the way his Lomax eventually reclaims his identity before enjoying some redemption is gently stirring.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Canelo lvarez Net Worth How Much is Canelo lvarez Worth?</h2><time>Sep 6, 2024</time>
