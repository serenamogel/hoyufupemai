At one point, in a shot so brief you don't want to blink, we even learn that the Popemobile travels in its own Popemobile. This inspires the theological puzzle of whether the one inside is the pope. One of my fellow viewers said she didn't even see a Popemobile. Maybe I dreamed it. In any event, there are no humans in the movie who could be the pope, although much is made of the dinosaurs who are a source of fossil fuels.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Julia Montes Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</h2><time>Jun 15, 2024</time>
