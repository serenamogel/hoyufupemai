She unknowingly walks into a burlesque club run by Tess (Cher), which is facing financial hardship despite its talented group of dancers.</p><p>Ali wants to audition but finds herself working at the club as a waitress. The film follows Ali as she fights her way from the bar to the stage while juggling a love triangle between sensitive bartender Jack (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Cam Gigandet</strong></a>) and wealthy real estate developer Marcus (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Eric Dane</strong></a>).</p><p>Aguilera told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Collider </a>in November 2010 that she wanted Ali’s character to be rewritten before she agreed to sign on to the project.</p><p>“They had to rewrite the character because I was just like, ‘This girl doesn’t have a lot of drive,'” she said at the time. “‘She doesn’t have enough meat. I think you should give it to someone else.’ I had an initial meeting with Amy Pascal and Clint Culpepper, and I said, ‘I just don’t think she’s for me. I want someone <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">with more bite and more passion</a> for what she wants in life.’ And so, they rewrote it.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The “Dirrty” singer </a>added that she channeled her lack of acting experience into the character.</p><p>“I also had to have a balance of starting out very vulnerable and wide-eyed and naive,” she explained. “I put that energy into how I really was feeling, approaching acting in the first place, which was wide-eyed and as a newcomer, who was open and vulnerable to everyone’s opinions and ideas, and ready to learn.”</p><p>Aguilera and Cher developed a close bond behind-the-scenes of the film that emulated their characters’ budding mother-daughter relationship in the movie. The “Believe” singer told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Collider</a> in November 2010 that she felt an immediate connection to Aguilera, whom she tried to mentor during filming.</p><p>“She reminded me of the relationship that I had with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Meryl Streep</strong></a> [on Silkwood], when Meryl took me under her wing,” she said at the time. “The truth was that I didn’t have any idea where to stand, not that I know where to stand now. I just learned what downstage and upstage is. But, Christina worked so hard. She overcame a lot. She came on the set with us, and that’s a little bit nerve-wracking when you’ve done nothing in film. I tried to put her at ease. As time went by, she felt a lot more comfortable.”</p><p>Although Cher enjoyed her time working on the movie, she admitted in 2013 that she wasn’t proud of the project.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It wasn’t a good film,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Moonstruck star </a>told the Los Angeles Times. “It had a few good moments, but I didn’t even like my performance that much. What, I don’t have a brain? I’m old but I’m still pretty on top of everything.”</p><p>Scroll down to see stars you may have forgot appeared in Burlesque.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BowaK%2B0mawqK1dm7yzs86tZLCdopp6qrqMm6yrpJWovraxjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dont-expect-kingpin-appear-netflixs-punisher-series.html><span>←</span><span>Dont Expect Kingpin To Appear In Netflixs Punisher Series</span></a>
