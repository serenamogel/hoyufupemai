Her character underwent some major changes in season three, a process that really displayed Raver-Lampman’s talent. As new fans swarm to the 33-year-old actress, they have questions about everything from her previous work to her height. We’re here to answer those questions.</p><h2 id=h-how-tall-is-emmy-raver-lampman data-injectable=false>How tall is Emmy Raver-Lampman?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Emmy_Raver-Lampman.jpg><p data-characters=517 data-current-count=817 data-injectable=true>While she is by no means short, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Umbrella Academy</a>’s Number Three is one of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">smaller members of the cast</a>. Raver-Lampman stands a few inches taller than two of her Umbrella Academy team members, but clocks in a few inches below the rest of her on-screen siblings. Raver-Lampman stands at approximately 5 foot 8 inches, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celeb Heights</a>, a full seven inches taller than the cast’s shortest member — Elliot Page — and three inches taller than the second shortest member of the team, Aidan Gallagher.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=549 data-current-count=549 data-injectable=false>Each of her remaining siblings — including Justin H. Min’s Ben — stand at least a few inches taller than Raver-Lampman. Apart from the 5 foot 5 inch tall Gallagher, Raver-Lampman is closest in height to H. Min, who clocks in between 5’8” and 5’11”, depending on who you believe. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celeb Heights</a> claims the former — which would make him the same height as Raver-Lampman — but H. Min himself contests this assertion. He claims to stand several inches taller, and we’re inclined to believe him. Even if he’s fudging the truth a bit.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1sMOMrZilpF2ewG6xzKawZqqRq7KzecuapKmlkaN6p77OpmSnnaSbuarE0masppqimrmtrYyampqclaLGcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./great-movie-body-heat-1981.html><span>←</span><span>Body Heat movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1981)</span></a>
