Prior to writing this article, my evaporated milk knowledge boiled down (heh) to just the basics: It’s shelf-stable and it’s a potential substitute for baby formula. After asking around, I found out I was clearly missing out on something special; the Southerners in my life all lit up when I asked if Carnation really belonged in macaroni and cheese. Of course, those same folks were less excited when I told them why I was asking. Not many people really got behind the concept of “spicy dairy” and I can’t blame them. To quote a relative of mine, “that ain’t right.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Where can I get this oxymoron-in-a-can?</h3><p>Carnation Kickin’ Jalapeño Flavored Evaporated Milk is only available inside Carnation’s “Mac It Better” kits, made in partnership with TikToker Tineke Younger (aka <a href=# rel=noopener>@Tini</a>) whose <a href=# rel=noopener>mac and cheese recipe</a> (made with evaporated milk and “corkscrew” pasta) went viral last year. They’re giving these kids out through a <a href=# rel=noopener>dedicated website</a> in timed drops. Unfortunately, the first drop date has already passed us by, but you’ll have your chance again soon; Drops #2 and #3 are taking place on July 9th and 14th. You’ll have to be quick though; Carnation is offering just 175 “Mac It Better” kits across the entire promotion.</p><p>Each kit comes with Tini’s recipe, a can of regular Carnation Evaporated Milk, a can of this new spicy evaporated milk, and a $25 gift card for all the other ingredients.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Is this really going to make macaroni and cheese better?</h3><p>Listen, I’m a macaroni and cheese purist. I’ve had plenty of “innovations” and I’m still not convinced we need to invite any new textures and flavors to this party. I’ll flip a picnic table if someone brings a batch topped with bread crumbs to my god-fearing American cookout. My only concession is that a good “<a href=# rel=noopener>piggy mac</a>” is absolutely divine. That said, I’ve primarily had that combination in the form of macaroni and cheese being the topping to a good pulled pork, so maybe that’s the important distinction. Speaking of using macaroni and cheese as a topping, weren’t we promised <a href=#>Mac on Tap</a> by Stouffer’s a few years ago? Are they still patenting the macaroni kegs? Where is my on-demand pasta sludge!?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJuRp7uiwMiopWaroJ6wunnJmqOaqJWjvG6x1ZqnqKqRqbKlecyio6RlnprEtHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jeff-koinange-wife-shaila-koinange-married-life.html><span>←</span><span>Jeff Koinange Wife Shaila Koinange Married Life Children And Wedding Photos</span></a>
