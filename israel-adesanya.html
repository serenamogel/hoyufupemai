He has also competed in Kickboxing and boxing and is ranked #4 in the UFC men's pound-for-pound rankings.</p><h2>Relationship Status</h2><p>The 31-year-old MMA fighter very well knows to keep his personal matters very private. He doesn't speak about his relationship and love life. However, Israel is very fond of hanging out with his female fans. Also, he can be spotted enjoying with different women. Unlike Adesanya, <a href=#><strong>Tim Elliott</strong></a> has a girlfriend.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/9/14/Israelgf-1600088195810.jpg><p>While some people claim he is gay, Israel's sexual orientation is certainly straight. An online forum once <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>posted</strong></a> a video of him sharing a bathtub with an unidentified woman. Further, Israel was seen with the same woman posing for a portrait after defeating <strong>Robert Whittaker</strong> on <i>October 2019</i>.</p><p>Israel is so much a secretive person that none of his past romantic entanglements have surfaced in public. He is also an unmarried man. At present, he might be possibly single, or he might be dating a woman in secret.

In his school, Israel was the only black kid in his class. He was bullied continuously, but later, he learned to fight. Recalling his childhood bully, Israel said:</p><p>'It was weird being the only black kid around. I had to defend myself a lot. I'm cheeky, I'm annoying so I'd always get myself into trouble, and eventually, I had to learn how to defend myself. That's when my search for fighting came through.'</p><p>Israel further shared one day, he cried in front of the mirror after being picked on. Afterward, he gave himself a pep motivation talk. Since then, he has been doing self-talks and has excelled at bragging his confidence.</p><h2>Family Background</h2><p>Israel Mobolaji Adesanya was born on <i>July 29, 1989,</i> in Lagos, Nigeria.
