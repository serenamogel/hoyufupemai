For instance, you can become incredibly wealthy and hire other adult human beings to do all of the annoying things for you. If bringing on a staff is not an option, you can make your morning routine easier by purchasing <a href=#>bottled iced coffee</a>. Coffee-mate, ubiquitous <a href=#>coffee creamer</a> brand, is here to help. They recently released dairy-free, bottled iced coffee bevs in two flavors: French Vanilla and Caramel. Will these eliminate the necessity to make an extra stop at the coffee shop in the a.m.? We tasted both flavors to find out.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="coffee-mate iced coffee review" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NPR_COFFEEMATE-ICED-COFFEE_INSET-01.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">New Product!</p><strong>Coffee-mate French Vanilla Iced Coffee</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Nestle</a><p>If you like the coffee that’s dispensed by those cappuccino machines they have a gas stations and truck stops, you’ll like Coffee-mate iced coffee. If drinking a cold version of truck stop cappuccino sounds bad to you, you might want to try something else (maybe a nice cold brew).</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> If you drink coffee more as a sweet treat than a biologically necessary morning mood stabilizer, this tastes pretty good. It’s not very coffee forward; it’s milky and sweet and smooth with a hint of coffee flavor. Both Coffee-mate Iced Coffee varieties are made <a href=#>plant-based milk</a>, so vegans and the lactose intolerant can enjoy them, too.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> If you drink coffee because you like the taste of coffee, I’m not sure this will hit the spot. You’d be better off spiking a good cold brew with some Coffee-mate creamer.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Nestle</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="caramel coffee mate iced coffee" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NPR_COFFEEMATE-ICED-COFFEE_INSET-02.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">New Product!</p><strong><strong>Coffee-mate Caramel Iced Coffee</strong></strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Nestle</a><p>Both flavors of new Coffee-mate Iced Coffee are pretty similar in overall taste and consistency, but I personally liked the caramel a little bit better. There’s a little bit of butteriness that makes the flavor more complex, rather than just sweet, sweet, sweet.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Make no bones about it: Coffee-mate Iced Coffee is sweet. But, as the bottle advertises, it’s lower in sugar than other, dairy-based iced coffee bevs. The difference isn’t huge (21 grams of sugar per serving versus 29 grams), but it’s something!</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Even though this tastes pretty good, I just don’t think it’s going to hit the spot for many coffee drinkers.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Nestle</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>5.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><a href=# class="lazy-load-youtube preview-lazyload preview-youtube" data-video-title="Tomato Soup & Grilled Cheese SOUP DUMPLINGS?! | Sporked" title='Play video "Tomato Soup & Grilled Cheese SOUP DUMPLINGS?! | Sporked"' rel=noopener>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgbDU7SGRaE&list=PLHbjKrchTZzsSSNxQfCn9JpW3evHOmxqK</a></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJufm7OmsYymmK2dXZ6wprCMnKafnpWaerOx1aKcsGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sonia-bruganelli-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-681968-html.html><span>←</span><span>Sonia Bruganelli Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
