<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Bullitt movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1968)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>McQueen plays a San Francisco cop assigned as bodyguard to a syndicate witness. The witness gets shotgunned -- in the most brutally direct 10 seconds of film I can remember -- and McQueen becomes a political football. <a href=#>Robert Vaughn</a> (better than usual) is the politician who puts the heat on, and it's up to McQueen to hide the victim's body until he can untangle the case.</p><p>It's a very tangled case, too. The beautiful thing is that Yates and his writers keen everything straight. There's nothing worse than a complicated plot that loses track of itself (as in "The Lady in Cement," which I defy anyone to explain).</p><p>"Bullitt" is Yates second film; his first was "<a href=#>Robbery</a>," a superior movie about England's great train robbery, which played Chicago earlier this year. "Robbery" had a great chase sequence in it, involving a running machine gun battle, all sorts of near misses in heavy traffic, lots of blood and remarkable photography.</p><p>"Bullitt," as everybody has heard by now, also includes a brilliant chase scene. McQueen (doing his own driving) is chased by, and chases, a couple of gangsters up and down San Francisco's hills. They slam into intersections, bounce halfway down the next hill, scrape by half a dozen near-misses, sideswipe each other, and leave your stomach somewhere in the basement for about 11 minutes.</p><p>One trouble. They couldn't be satisfied with a cop movie, I guess; they had to have sex appeal, and so they brought in <a href=#>Jacqueline Bisset</a> (a lovely sight, true) to be McQueen's girl. And every line she recites is disastrously inappropriate. She has one speech so awful it takes the movie five minutes to recover.</p><p>Yates pulled the same trick in "Robbery" (1968), giving <a href=#>Stanley Baker</a> a wife he didn't need so the movie could have three unnecessary scenes with her. And <a href=#>Lee Remick</a> cluttered up "<a href=#>The Detective</a>." And Inga Stevens was extra baggage in "Madigan." They ought to leave the girls out or make them policewomen, like "<a href=#>Coogan's Bluff</a>" did, come to think of it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46brKWkmanBbn2Yb28%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./maya-milletes-husband-choked-her-to-the-point-of-unconsciousness-before-her-disappearance.html><span>←</span><span>Maya Milletes husband choked her to the point of unconsciousness before her disappearance</span></a>
