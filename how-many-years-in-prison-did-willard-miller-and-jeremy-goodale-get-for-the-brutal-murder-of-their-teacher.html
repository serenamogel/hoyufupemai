But, unfortunately, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Willard “Chaiden” Miller and Jeremy Goodale</strong></a> fall into this category. In Nov. 2021 the two sixteen-year-olds stalked their 66-year-old <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish teacher Nohema Graber</a> to a park she often frequented and bludgeoned her to death with a baseball bat.</p><p data-characters=493 data-current-count=493 data-injectable=true>Upon the body’s discovery, both were quickly suspected due to their activity on Snapchat. Goodale posted some nasty, self-implicating photos, but was not the mastermind of the crime, as that role fell onto Miller, the one who was going to fail Graber’s class and feared being <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">prevented from attending an exchange trip to Spain</a> because of it. Hence, the two Iowa teens involved in the same crime got slightly different sentences for their different roles and contrasting attitudes in court.</p><h2 id=h-life-with-the-possibility-of-parole data-injectable=false>Life with the possibility of parole</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Design-sem-nome-84.png><p data-characters=148 data-current-count=448 data-injectable=true>Jeremy Goodale and Willard Miller were both sentenced to life in prison. However, their juvenile status means parole remains a possibility for them.</p><p data-characters=506 data-current-count=506 data-injectable=true>That being said, Goodale, who visibly showed more remorse in court than his “friend,” and the one who “made the worst decision of [his] life” just to socially prove something, is eligible for release after 25 years. That’s also partly thanks to a plea agreement that had him testify against his schoolmate. On the other hand, Miller got five more years than the 30-year minimum prosecutors were recommending. The one who kickstarted the murder plan is going to be over 50 when and if he gets out.</p><p data-characters=342 data-current-count=342 data-injectable=false>The stark difference in attitude of both convicted murderers is clear in their statements to the deceased’s family and those impacted by the heinous deed. Nonetheless, the judge still took all aggravating factors into account when sentencing, namely, that Goodale had the chance to prevent the crime and decided to go along with it instead.</p><p data-characters=457 data-current-count=799 data-injectable=false>Significantly, Goodale has Graber’s son, Christian, believing he “can be a good man.” Let’s hope that 25 years is enough for him to pave an unshakable path in that direction, and that, for Miller, an additional decade in jail to ponder over his horrific actions will aid him in getting to the same conclusion. In the meantime, with justice served, hopefully, Nohema Graber’s loved ones can find the closest semblance of peace possible.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8eormalkaPGbsXEmqmsZZmjerG%2ByKymp2WUnrFuw8ilo5qqlGK6qrjLnqlmmZ6Zequx0Z6ksmWXpLylrcueZKCdpGKzsL6MrZ%2BeZZKnwrWty2akrqqUmr9uu8Vmq6Gdmad6tbHAnJ%2Beql8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./christopher-renz.html><span>←</span><span>Christopher Renz movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</span></a>
