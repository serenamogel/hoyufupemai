It would seem that Micron this morning has accidentally spilled the beans on the future of graphics card memory technologies – and outed one of NVIDIA’s next-generation RTX video cards in the process. In a technical brief that was posted to their website, dubbed “The Demand for Ultra-Bandwidth Solutions”, Micron detailed their portfolio of high-bandwidth memory technologies and the market needs for them. Included in this brief was information on the previously-unannounced GDDR6X memory technology, as well as some information on what seems to be the first card to use it, NVIDIA’s GeForce RTX 3090.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Riccardo Tisci: dating, net worth, tattoos, smoking &amp;amp; body facts</h2><time>Jan 1, 1</time>

If studios’ reaction to the dual Hollywood strike is any indication, things are not going well for them. The Writers’ Guild of America first started picketing in May amid increasing concerns over AI and lack of residuals, with SAG-AFTRA following soon after. After months of negotiating, studios have still not come to terms with the writers and actors that make film and television possible.
