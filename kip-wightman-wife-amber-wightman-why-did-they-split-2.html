He popped the question a year earlier than their wedding during a holiday in Tanzania.</p><p>They welcomed their first child in 2019. However, they got divorced in March 2021.</p><p>It is the first time he was married. His first wife’s name is Leanne, with whom he separated in 2009. We are not aware of the reason for his divorce from his first wife.</p><p>The TV host joined the Nova team in 2005 but left it for a certain time period after his first marriage broke apart.

He announced his divorce from his wife earlier this year.</p><p>He mentioned that it was a difficult time, but they were focused on prioritizing their one-year-old son. According to&nbsp;Daily Mail,&nbsp;when the kid was 10 months old, an aluminum Macbook fell on him and severed his hand.</p><p>He was not present when the incident happened. His wife was traumatized by it when she saw her infant’s pinky finger chopped off. He was rushed to hospital and luckily the surgeons could set his finger back.</p><p>Nevertheless, since then the couple has not much been on social media. Besides, the reason behind their split is because of the difference in a way of life they wish to live. It seems it was based on mutual understanding.</p><p>Despite their separation, it seems they are in contact and maybe friends as Kip has not removed any photos of his former wife from his IG profile. But, Amber, however, has deactivated her account.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-kip-and-amber-wightman-have-kids></span>Do Kip and Amber Wightman Have Kids?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kip and Amber Wightman are parents to a kid, possibly a toddler.
