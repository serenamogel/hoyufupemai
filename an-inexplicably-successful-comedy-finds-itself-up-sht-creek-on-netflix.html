The treasure-hunting travesty was resoundingly panned to end up with a paltry Rotten Tomatoes score of 14 percent, but the general public vehemently disagreed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/without-a-paddle.jpg><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=265 data-injectable=false>Not only did Without a Paddle earn $73 million at the box office on a $19 million budget, but over 250,000 user ratings on RT have established a remarkably (and very surprising) score of 68 percent. The people have spoken, and they got a real kick out of the movie.</p><p data-characters=422 data-current-count=687 data-injectable=true>Dax Shepard, Matthew Lillard, Seth Green pay tribute to their dead friend by going on a camping trip in his honor, where they set out to find the treasure of D.B. Cooper that their buddy believed was buried somewhere around the location. Naturally, things soon go awry, leaving the trio of hapless homies stranded in the wilderness and facing a serious battle against the odds and the elements to plot an escape to safety.</p><p data-characters=104 data-current-count=104 data-injectable=false>It’s standard comedic fare, but Netflix subscribers have been more than happy to give it a chance.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomKdlmaOyubzLopqampyuerTBwpycrKuWqrlur86mnJ2xXZu2r7DSZqCtq5Whs27Bz2aqoaxdmL%2BmscpmpqdlnprBp7jIsWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-noah-beck-dead-death-hoax-debunked.html><span>←</span><span>Is Noah Beck Dead?
