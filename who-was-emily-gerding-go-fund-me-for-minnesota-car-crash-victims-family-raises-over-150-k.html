She was reportedly a special education teacher at Coon Rapids Middle School, along with her husband John. Officials said that the suspect was escaping a traffic ticket and going between 70 and 90 mph when he crashed into the couple's minivan leading to Gerding's death. "The suspect vehicle crossed 36th Avenue North at a very high rate of speed, striking a vehicle traveling on 36th," Elder said.&nbsp;</p><p>Gerding leaves behind two daughters, six-year-old Emelia (6) and three-year-old Eleanor, and her husband, who is in critical condition. She is also survived by her mother, Linda Darmer, her sister, Samantha Pherson, and brother-in-law, Luke, among other loved ones. Gerding's family said that she was set to turn 35 in July and was busy planning a Elton John-themed party for Eleanor's third birthday, which also falls in July.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Sachin Hawkins: GoFundMe raises over $24K as New York teen studying in UK killed by housemate</a></p><p>Gerding and John were also about to celebrate their seventh wedding anniversary in August.

The fundraiser received immense support from community members, Gerding's loved ones and social media users. "On July 8th, 2023 Emily and John Gerding were involved in a horrific vehicle collision. Their van was hit at an extremely high rate of speed by a vehicle that was allegedly fleeing a simple traffic ticket," the page read.&nbsp;</p><p>"The Robbinsdale police, Robbinsdale Fire Department, West Metro Fire District, and North Memorial ambulance crews did everything they could on the scene, but Emily's life was tragically lost. John remains hospitalized in critical condition with significant injuries. He's medically stable now but has a very long and difficult road ahead for recovery. Updates are added to his CaringBridge site as family are able to do so," it continued.&nbsp;</p><p>"Their two wonderful daughters, Emelia (6) and Eleanor (almost 3), thankfully were not in the vehicle at the time of the collision. Emelia and Eleanor are currently being cared for by close family. The family is facing significant expenses for Emily's funeral, John's ongoing medical care, and looking toward their girls' future. All donations will go to John and their girls," the fundraiser concluded, in part. As of Thursday, July 13, the GoFundMe raised $154,909 of its $200,000 goal.</p><p><span><b>More from <i>MEAWW</i></b></span></p><p><a href=#>Alexander Bulakhov: GoFundMe for Tennessee doctor killed while defending family from robbery raises $53,367</a></p><p><a href=#>GoFundMe for murdered teen Jonathan Lewis crosses goal as parents leave touching message</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikerit0macpqGcrnqosdGdoKefXZy8brLUp5tmpZVis7C%2BjKagp6aVqLy1rYycmKtlk6eutLSMr6CcrJmiwG6ywKagpbFdp66qv8SsZKiulad6coGPZqI%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lee-corso-age-wikipedia-biography-children-salary-net-worth-parents.html><span>←</span><span>Lee Corso Age, Wikipedia, Biography, Children, Salary, Net Worth, Parents.</span></a>
