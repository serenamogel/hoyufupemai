With each passing day, studios look more greedy with their refusal to meet the demands of their employees. Now the AMPTP has hired a PR crisis management team, the Levinson Group. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a> revealed that the new PR team will be led by Molly Levinson, who has managed well-known conflicts such as the U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team during their fight for pay equality. SAG-AFTRA has also taken things seriously with a new PR firm of its own, but the AMPTP’s bid for damage control has led to a specific reaction from those following the strike.</p><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>Notable industry professionals have pointed out that this is at least the third PR company that the AMPTP has employed in recent months. American producer and director, Joe Russo—the mind behind Nightmare Cinema and Beer Run—was one of many who aired their opinions on Twitter.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=582 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>One PR firm?

Studios and the AMPTP are giving a masterclass in buffoonery that will be talked about for years. <a href=#>https://t.co/Esl5AfIPdQ</a></p>— Gina Ippolito (@GinaIppy) <a href=#>August 26, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=216 data-current-count=516 data-injectable=true>Writers consumed with the grind of striking had a less humorous take on the situation.

They previously stated their intention to keep the strike going until creatives were financially unable to continue. If their plan was to appear as unrelatable as possible, that is the one area where they are succeeding. They sound closer to the likes of Lex Luthor and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">others on the wrong side of history</a>. Writers are at the end of their rope, only wanting to be treated fairly. The 100 and Star Trek: Prodigy writer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Julie Benson</a> noted that PR teams are for people who are losing in the court of public opinion. Perhaps studios have enough money that they don’t need to worry about that, but it will be a nightmare when this strike eventually resolves itself. She further pointed out that this will be the time when studios will really need a PR team.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>And honestly, AMPTP, hire that PR team. You DO need it. Just do it AFTER the strike ends to rebuild public opinion. The hard work is going to be getting people to want to invest time in our shows and movies when they’ve seen how awful you’ve been. <a href=#>https://t.co/g4Hxlsshh9</a></p>— Julie Benson (@TheJulieBenson) <a href=#>August 26, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=171 data-current-count=471 data-injectable=false>While it’s safe to say that the studios have lost in the eye of the public, it remains to be seen how long it will take before this standoff finally comes to an end.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9KtrJ2hn6h6orrDZquhnV2WurHAz2aYq51dnLa3tc2gZJplnZbAtbHRnKOaq6Nitq95wa6dn6efo7KzxYylmK2do6l6sbjAp2Stp12ZsqK4jLCgraBdrLSiedKtqaKjlWK0psDSZpmaq5iasW7AzmaroZ1dorywuoyapZ1lkpawrHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./riccardo-tisci-dating-net-worth-tattoos-smoking-body-facts.html><span>←</span><span>Riccardo Tisci: dating, net worth, tattoos, smoking &amp;amp; body facts</span></a>
