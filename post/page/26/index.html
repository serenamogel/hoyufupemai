<a href=../../../rhett-link-gmm-milka-bar-flavors.html></a>
For those uninitiated, Milka is a Swiss chocolate company headquartered in Germany, where the chocolate is also produced. They kind of remind me of what would happen if Cadbury and Lindt had a glorious milk-chocolate-bar child—that is to say, famous for being creamy, European, and dressed in pretty, pretty purple.
On a November 2022 episode of Good Mythical Morning, Rhett & Link set out to determine “der beste” of the 31 Milka bar flavors they could get their hands on, and, boy, did these bars look good (TBH, Rhett & Link liked all of the flavors at least a little bit).</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Tahini Cookies</h2><time>Jul 15, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../best-tzatziki-sauce.html></a>
The best tzatziki sauce is creamy and tangy, laden with fresh dill, cucumber, and a hint of lemon and olive oil. It should have a cooling effect on your palate, making it the perfect complement to grilled meats and a lovely dip for raw veggies.
Tzatziki sauce is so gosh darn yummy, it’s worth the headache of trying to spell (and pronounce) it correctly. And despite being so delicious, it defies the laws of physics and nature by somehow also being ridiculously healthy for you.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Friends (GO) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</h2><time>Jul 14, 2024</time>
