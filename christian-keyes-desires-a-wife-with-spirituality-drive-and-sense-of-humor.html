Keyes would begin with a bouquet of flowers, followed by a romantic dinner. He’d then take his girlfriend to a concert, after which they’d go out for dessert and then back to his place.</p><p>When asked what kind of woman he would choose for a date, the Saints and Sinners actor listed three major qualities he looks for in a woman: spirituality, drive, and a sense of humor. Keyes explained why he wants his partner to be driven and ambitious after a brief discussion about the importance of spirituality. He wants her to be self-sufficient and believes she will be fine without him.</p><p>Keyes wants his partner to be the same way he is when he’s not working because he is such a playful soul when he’s not working.</p><h2>Wedding Preparations</h2><p>The In Contempt actor appears to be single right now, but he hopes to marry someday. In a May 2018 interview with The Rolling Out, he discussed it. When asked why he hadn’t married despite having a grown-up son, Keyes reiterated his desire for a wife, claiming he was financially stable to marry and start a family.</p><p>The Detroit native expressed his desire to have more children and adopt at least one child, ideally with a loving wife. Returning to the topic of the ideal partner, Keyes stated that his wife would have to dress properly and be able to speak up for herself.
