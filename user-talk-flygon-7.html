This is not acceptable on Bulbapedia. It may seem totally reasonable to you, but we still do <i>not</i> make such assumptions; we <i>wait</i> for some sort of official confirmation.</p><p>If you do have some source, please let me know what it is. <a href=# title=User:Tiddlywinks>Tiddlywinks</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:Tiddlywinks">talk</a>) 23:37, 5 May 2016 (UTC)</p>Those were not assumptions. I am a Spanish guy and I got my code and my own Yveltal, so just took the info from there. If you need some screenshots as proof just ask for them&nbsp;:). If there is no problem I'll leave the info as I wrote it before. --<a href=# class=new title="User:Flygon 7 (page does not exist)">Flygon 7</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink" href=#>talk</a>) 00:36, 6 May 2016 (UTC) OK. There are at least two apparent problems with what you originally edited, then. First, the ID probably <i>shouldn't</i> be the same as it was for Zygarde. It would be great if you could double-check that. Secondly, unless you captured the Wonder Card technical data or looked directly at Yveltal's—or maybe hacked Yveltal to make it a lower level—you probably can't be sure that Yveltal's moves are actually relearnable (since they're all level-up moves and Yveltal is level 100). If you're not actually certain, please don't assume they are. <a href=# title=User:Tiddlywinks>Tiddlywinks</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:Tiddlywinks">talk</a>) 00:43, 6 May 2016 (UTC) The ID is oddly correct, and I just took a look at its info using PkHex and the 4 moves are marked as "Egg moves". --<a href=# class=new title="User:Flygon 7 (page does not exist)">Flygon 7</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink" href=#>talk</a>) 00:48, 6 May 2016 (UTC) Hm, that is odd. Thanks for checking both those things. And sorry for the mistake, then. <a href=# title=User:Tiddlywinks>Tiddlywinks</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:Tiddlywinks">talk</a>) 00:50, 6 May 2016 (UTC)<h2><span class=mw-headline id=Shiny_Yveltal_event>Shiny Yveltal event</span></h2><p>I noticed above you said that you got your own code for it. So I am wondering if there is any way you could get a scan (or a picture if you can't get a scan) of its serial code card for the PAL region serial code page? <b><a href=# title="User:Lady Ariel"><span>Lady</span></a> <a href=# title="User talk:Lady Ariel"><span>Ariel</span></a></b> 03:05, 6 May 2016 (UTC)</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Anime_moves>Anime moves</span></h2><p>I see you're removing anime moves that aren't identified, but I just want to make sure that you're checking closed captions which at times do identify moves that aren't vocally identified.</p><p>Also, it may be that some moves not on Force Fire's user page can still be argued to be unique.

I noticed that you have been adding the Spanish names for the areas in Pokémon Rumble U, that's very nice! However you seem to make a distinction between the article's name and the other's. That is a distinction that we don't generally do here. Therefore I ask of you to not make that distinction in future edits and simply use ''&lt;name>'' on all names and not just the article's. Thank you. --<a href=# title=User:Raltseye><span>R</span><span>alts</span><span>eye</span></a> <a href=# title="User talk:Raltseye">prata med mej</a> 10:04, 1 March 2018 (UTC)</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Fling_powers>Fling powers</span></h2><p>In 2017, <a href=# title=Special:Diff/2609919>you added</a> several items' Fling powers to the <a href=# title="Fling (move)">Fling</a> page.

As Lost Thunder is a large expansion, I hope that the pages won't be moved and edited unless you have all the information for the cards. Things to edit to the English version:</p><ul><li>Removing the TCG Unreleased tag</li><li>PokémoncardInfobox</li><li>Changing Thunderclap Spark/Fairy Rise/Super-Burst Impact/SM-P Promotional to Lost Thunder in the "It is part of [name] expansion" sentence</li><li>The <b>attack</b>s and <b>description</b> <b>IN ENGLISH</b></li><li>transdex to dex</li><li>Category:Lost Thunder cards</li><li>Release information (when applicable)</li></ul><p>I realized from previous expansions that you have missed several of the parts, and I had to go through the whole set to spot out the mistakes/those left out. As Lost Thunder is a very large set, I do not wish to have to check through all the card pages again. Also, this information will also be applicable to future English expansions.
