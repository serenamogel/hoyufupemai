B&B spoilers reveal that both women are sick of it and want Ridge to make a decision and stick with it. Now that Ridge is back this week (December 12), the Bold and the Beautiful fans will finally learn who Ridge selected.</p><p>Taylor has wanted to be Ridge’s wife for many years. She longs for her family to come together and enjoy life with Ridge and their children, Steffy Forrester (Jacqueline MacInnes Wood) and Thomas Forrester (Matthew Atkinson).</p><p>The B&B spoilers for the week reveal that Ridge chooses a woman, and the viewers think he will pick Brooke. It’s an educated guess based on showrunner Brad Bell’s obsession with making Brooke Ridge’s “destiny.”</p><p><img alt="The Bold And The Beautiful: Ridge Forrester (Thorsten Kaye)" width=800 height=409 data-jpibfi-post-excerpt data-jpibfi-post-url=https://celebbabylaundry.com/2022/12/the-bold-and-the-beautiful-bb-spoilers-ridges-emotional-goodbye-to-taylor-picks-brooke-steffy-and-thomas-heartbroken/ data-jpibfi-post-title="The Bold And The Beautiful (B&B) Spoilers: Ridge’s Emotional Goodbye To Taylor, Picks Brooke – Steffy And Thomas Heartbroken" data-jpibfi-src sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebbabylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BB-Taylor-and-Ridge.jpg></p><h3>The Bold And The Beautiful Updates – Ridge Forrester’s Choice Breaks Steffy Forrester And Thomas Forrester’s Hearts</h3><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Let’s assume Ridge picks Brooke.</a> If that happens, it will devastate Steffy and Thomas. Their dreams of their parents uniting will be over, and Taylor will struggle to accept Ridge’s decision.</p><p>Thomas will likely blame Steffy for Ridge’s decision. He will say that if she had stayed quiet, their parents would be on their honeymoon right now. Thomas isn’t wrong, but Steffy did the right thing. Ridge deserved to know the truth.</p><p>Ridge’s decision will likely upset Taylor, Steffy, and Thomas. Brooke will know that Ridge loves her and wants a life with her, turning his back (yet again) on Taylor and his children.</p><p>B&B fans, who do you think Ridge will choose?
