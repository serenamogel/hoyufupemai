<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Godzilla vs. Kong movie review (2021)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>More consequential and moving, though, are the human/monster and monster/monster relationships. Kong and Jia are a magical screen team, in the tradition of heart-tugging pairings in animal pictures like "<a href=#>The Black Stallion</a>," "<a href=#>Free Willy</a>," and "E.T." The latter resonates extra-hard. The movie treats&nbsp;Kong's heartbeat as a conduit to Jia's mental state,&nbsp;as well as narrative Morse code-pulses for the viewer that reveal Kong's stress level and physical condition. Obviously a lot of the credit for the Kong-Jia&nbsp;friendship should go to the filmmakers, including&nbsp;editor Josh&nbsp;Schaeffer ("Pacific Rim: Uprising"); cinematographer <a href=#>Ben Seresin</a> ("<a href=#>Unstoppable</a>,"&nbsp;"Pain and Gain"); and the nation-state of effects artists who did the designs, motion-capturing, rendering, compositing, etc. This a rare modern blockbuster with effects that are truly special.&nbsp;The Hollow Earth scenes in the middle of the picture, especially, are ecstatically dreamy kitsch, in the vein of a '70s sword-and-sorcery paperback book jacket,&nbsp;or a '70s-'80s psychedelic&nbsp;sci-fi or fantasy picture&nbsp;like "<a href=#>Zardoz</a>," "<a href=#>Flash Gordon</a>,"&nbsp;"<a href=#>Tron</a>" or&nbsp;"The Neverending Story." The neon primary colors in the Apex labs and Hong Kong streets are blissed-out decadent coolness: <a href=#>John Woo</a> by way of British synthpop&nbsp;videos. Kong and Godzie might as well have done lines of coke off the top of a bus before laying into each other.</p><p>And yet, as is increasingly the case, this special effects-laden epic is paradoxically an actor's showcase—and it's&nbsp;scandalous that <a href=#>Terry Notary</a>, who played Kong in this movie and&nbsp;"Skull Island," isn't being credited with the main cast, along with T.J. Storm, who has played Godzilla in three Monsterverse films.</p><p>Wingard is on record saying that the physicality of this King Kong is partly modeled on <a href=#>Bruce Willis</a> in the "<a href=#>Die Hard</a>" films and <a href=#>Mel Gibson</a> in the "<a href=#>Lethal Weapon</a>"&nbsp;series. You see the lineage in scenes of&nbsp;Kong dirty-fighting like a back-alley brawler, stumble-running through Hong Kong streets, and jumping&nbsp;off the deck of an aircraft carrier as&nbsp;Godzilla nukes&nbsp;it from below. But this is not just a great stunt-work job. It's according-to-Hoyle, Andy Serkis-caliber acting. Watch&nbsp;Kong cough up seawater after Godzilla almost drowns him, or collapse and doze off after vanquishing an enemy, or tear a&nbsp;winged beast's head&nbsp;from his neck and guzzle blood from the stump like a brigand&nbsp;downing a pint of&nbsp;mead.&nbsp;When&nbsp;Kong awakens after being airlifted to an Antarctic base to start his journey into the Hollow Earth, he has Martin&nbsp;Sheen's still-in-Saigon hangover-face from "Apocalypse&nbsp;Now." When Kong speaks sign language to Jia, looking away and then back at her, you see wheels turning in his mind: I&nbsp;hate what this kid just told me, and it's hard to get my mind around,&nbsp;but I accept it, because I&nbsp;have no choice.&nbsp;</p><p>Equally arresting, though more opaque, is Storm's performance as Godzilla. This kaiju&nbsp;is primordial and ruthless,&nbsp;a zaftig brawler with a Charles Barkley caboose.&nbsp;He lacks Kong's grace and ingenuity with weapons, but compensates with ferocity and weight (and dragon breath). Godzilla rages like <a href=#>James Gandolfini</a> in Tony Soprano murder-mode, slamming his bulk into&nbsp;any creature foolish&nbsp;enough to oppose him. He&nbsp;rears back with a&nbsp;glint in his eye before napalm-zapping city blocks. In a succession of bold first-person, shot/reverse shot close-ups, wherein Kong and Godzilla stare into each other's eyes, each trying to&nbsp;intimidate the other, Godzilla&nbsp;projects a mix of curiosity, alpha brutishness, and game-respect-game appreciation for the ape's refusal to submit.&nbsp;The look that Godzilla gives Kong at the end of the picture is <a href=#>Clint Eastwood</a> with scales. The curtain-closing song selection that follows is marvelously counter-intuitive—a needle-drop of joy—but it could also have been Leonard Cohen's "Famous Blue Raincoat":&nbsp;"What can I possibly say?/I guess that I miss you, I guess I forgive you/I’m glad you stood in my way.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46gpp2ymaG5onnVrGSkp56ceq671aKcZqqVq7amw4xrZ2tp</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ella-rae-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-46230-html.html><span>←</span><span>Ella Rae Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
