<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Lola Montes movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2008)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>His story involves the infamous Lola Montes, "The Most Scandalous Woman in the World," the mistress of Franz Liszt and King Ludwig of Bavaria, of students and artists, of soldiers and ringmasters. We find her in a New Orleans circus, the star attraction in a review of her sensational career. <a href=#>Peter Ustinov</a>, the ringmaster, narrates her past as Lola revolves on a platform. Later the customers will have their chance to spend a dollar and kiss her hand.</p><p>The device of the circus is as successful as it is daring. Using it to supply his narrative thread, Ophuls slides through a series of flashbacks with as much ease, and psychological completeness, as Welles exhibited in "<a href=#>Citizen Kane</a>." The structure of the film is terribly artificial -- flashbacks suspended from a fantasy circus -- and the style itself is a highly mannered romanticism. But it works; Ophuls understands and justifies his method.</p><p>He is not so successful, unfortunately, with the performance of the late <a href=#>Martine Carol</a> in the title role. Famous in the 1950s as a sort of prototype Bardot, Miss Carol was a third-rate actress, and she comes across as wooden, shallow, not even very attractive.</p><p>Ophuls apparently needed Miss Carol's box-office name to help justify his $1,500,000 budget (this was the most expensive French film to date when it was completed in 1955). He tries to make an advantage of her weakness by directing her almost as a doll; her function is to watch impassively while her lovers save her scenes. The best performance in the film is by <a href=#>Anton Walbrook</a> as the deaf, touching old king. Peter Ustinov is typically excellent. <a href=#>Oskar Werner</a>, as a young student, is not much better than ever.</p><p>Note: "Lola Montes" was a commercial flop when Ophuls released it in 1955. He died two years later, still engaged in a battle with the film's producers. A savagely butchered version was in circulation for a few years. Through the efforts of the Village Voice's Andrew Sarris and other lovers of the film, the original, uncut version was shown at the 1963 New York Film Festival and again at last year's festival.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46lpqWZXaK8r8DErGRqcWVq</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-alex-vallee-everything-to-know-about-jean-marc-vallee-son.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Alex Valle?
