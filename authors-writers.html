The author was as fascinating a character as those who appeared in his stories. A brilliant yet largely unmotivated student, Capote began pursuing a writing career as a teenager and first found success in the mid-1940s with the publication of several short stories. His 1948 debut novel, Other Voices, Other Rooms, was followed by Breakfast at Tiffany’s and 1966’s In Cold Blood, a pioneering form of narrative nonfiction. Capote pursued celebrity throughout his life, making friends with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/celebrities/gloria-vanderbilt data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Gloria Vanderbilt" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Gloria Vanderbilt</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/jacqueline-kennedy-onassis data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jacqueline Kennedy" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jacqueline Kennedy</a>, and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/harper-lee data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Harper Lee" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Harper Lee</a>, among others. In his later years, he struggled with substance abuse. Capote died in 1984, one month before his 60th birthday.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 title="Quick Facts" data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quick Facts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">FULL NAME: Truman Garcia Capote<br>BORN: September 30, 1924<br>DIED: August 25, 1984<br>BIRTHPLACE: New Orleans, Louisiana<br>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Libra</p><h2 data-node-id=12 title="Early Life" data-anchor-id=early-life class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Truman Garcia Capote was born Truman Streckfus Persons on September 30, 1924, in New Orleans. His parents were an odd pair—a small-town woman named Lillie Mae and a charming schemer called Arch—and they largely neglected their son, often leaving him in the care of others. Truman spent much of his young life in the care of his mother’s relatives in Monroeville, Alabama.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In Monroeville, Truman befriended a young <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/harper-lee data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Harper Lee" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Harper Lee</a>. The two were opposites: he was a sensitive boy who was picked on by other kids for being a wimp, while she was a rough and tumble tomboy. Despite their differences, Harper found Truman to be a delight, calling him “a pocket Merlin” for his creative and inventive ways. Little did these playful pals know that they would both become famous writers one day.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Keep Reading</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Although he had fun with his friends, Truman also had to struggle with his nightmarish family life. Seeing little of his mother and his father over the years, he often wrestled with feeling abandoned by them. One of the few times he caught their interest was during their divorce with each of them fighting for custody as a way to hurt the other. Truman finally did get to live with his mother full time in 1932, but this reunion didn’t turn out as he had hoped. He moved to New York City to live with her and his new stepfather, Joe Capote.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">His once-doting mother was quite different once he started to encounter her on a daily basis. Lillie Mae, now calling herself Nina, could easily be cruel or kind to Truman, and he never knew what to expect from her. She often picked on him for his effeminate ways and for not being like other boys. His stepfather seemed to be a more stable personality in the home, but Truman wasn’t interested in his help or support at the time. Still, he was officially adopted by his stepfather, and his name was changed to Truman Garcia Capote in 1935.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A mediocre student, Capote did well in the courses that interested him and paid little attention in those that didn’t. From 1933 to 1936, he attended Manhattan’s Trinity School, a private boys’ school, where he charmed some of his classmates. Capote, an unusual boy, had a gift for telling stories and entertaining people. His mother wanted to make him more masculine and thought that sending him to a military academy would do the trick. At St. John’s Military Academy, the 1936-1937 school year proved to be a disaster for Capote. The smallest in his class, he was often picked on by the other cadets.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Returning to Manhattan, Capote started to attract attention for his work at school. Some of his teachers noted his promise as a writer. In 1939, the Capotes moved to Greenwich, Connecticut, where Truman enrolled at Greenwich High School. He stood out among his classmates with his ebullient personality. Over time, Capote developed a group of friends who often went to his house to smoke, drink, and dance in his room. They also went out to nearby clubs. Seeking adventure as well as an escape, Capote and his good friend Phoebe Pierce visited New York City multiple times and schemed their way into some of the most popular nightspots, including the Stork Club and Café Society.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While the Capotes were living in Greenwich, Nina’s drinking began to escalate, which made Capote’s home life even more unstable. Capote didn’t do well in school and had repeat the 12th grade at The Franklin School (now The Dwight School) after he and his family returned to Manhattan in 1942. Instead of studying, Capote spent his nights at the clubs, making friends with Oona O’Neill, the daughter of playwright <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/eugene-oneill data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Eugene O’Neill" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Eugene O’Neill</a> and writer Agnes Boulton, and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/celebrities/gloria-vanderbilt data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Gloria Vanderbilt" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Gloria Vanderbilt</a>, heiress of railroad magnate <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/business-leaders/cornelius-vanderbilt data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cornelius Vanderbilt" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Cornelius Vanderbilt</a>’s fortune, among others.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 title="Early Career: Short Story Success" data-anchor-id=early-career-short-story-success class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early Career: Short Story Success</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While still a teen, Capote got his first job working as a copyboy for The New Yorker magazine. During his time with the publication, Capote tried to get his stories published there with no success. He left The New Yorker to write full-time and started the novel <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/Summer-Crossing-Modern-Library-Paperbacks/dp/0812975936 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Summer Crossing" data-vars-ga-product-id=3da8befb-e328-47a1-b7c5-0cad84958a1d data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.amazon.com/Summer-Crossing-Modern-Library-Paperbacks/dp/0812975936 data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/Summer-Crossing-Modern-Library-Paperbacks/dp/0812975936 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.com/Summer-Crossing-Modern-Library-Paperbacks/dp/0812975936 data-affiliate-network='{"id":"c754abb3-3204-4f94-a191-fe83f09385e4","site_id":"73ce8f33-abd8-4d76-b5c7-1c72caf717ce","metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","metadata":{}}}' data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=3b56ed1d-ca7c-40d9-a97c-d1d874b1ee60 class="body-link product-links css-9lyfaf e1rq56bv0">Summer Crossing</a>, which he shelved to work on a novella entitled Other Voices, Other Rooms.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Capote’s first successes weren’t his novels but several short stories. In 1945, editor George Davis selected Capote’s story “Miriam” about a strange little girl for publication in Mademoiselle. In addition to befriending Davis, Capote became close to his assistant Rita Smith, the sister of famous southern author Carson McCullers. She later introduced the two, and Capote and McCullers were friends for a time.</p><p><h2 class="css-hsosn9 erccrpd0">The Complete Stories of Truman Capote</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="$14 at Amazon for The Complete Stories of Truman Capote" data-href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/140009691X data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/140009691X data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/140009691X data-affiliate-network='{"id":"c754abb3-3204-4f94-a191-fe83f09385e4","site_id":"73ce8f33-abd8-4d76-b5c7-1c72caf717ce","is_active":true,"details":null,"metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","is_active":true,"business_unit_id":"ad046b46-538b-42cb-aa54-c3d158875ed6","details":"","metadata":{},"created_at":"2021-07-28T16:03:03.241365+00:00","last_updated_at":"2021-07-28T16:03:03.241381+00:00"}}' data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$14 at Amazon" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/dp/140009691X data-vars-ga-product-brand=Vintage data-vars-ga-product-id=8af702d4-9eb3-4b67-b2c9-98ae327fdd50 data-vars-ga-product-price=$14.41 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=d218e9db-9208-4f36-b9cc-56ccd346c86c data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=Vintage data-vars-ga-link-treatment="sale | On Sale" data-vars-ga-sku=140009691X data-vars-ga-magento-tracking=1 class="product-image-link e1c4wdig0 e14dd8uh0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="The Complete Stories of Truman Capote" title="The Complete Stories of Truman Capote" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1706213629-61jhQGuN4wL.jpg width=778 height=1200 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><h2 class="css-hsosn9 erccrpd0">The Complete Stories of Truman Capote</h2></p><p>Now 15% Off</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Capote’s story in Mademoiselle attracted the attention of Harper’s Bazaar fiction editor Mary Louise Aswell. The publication ran another dark and eerie story by Capote titled “A Tree of Light” in its October 1945 issue. These stories as well as “My Side of the Matter” and “Jug of Silver” helped launch Capote’s career and gave him entrée into the New York literary world.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While struggling to work on his first novel, Capote received some assistance from McCullers. She helped him get accepted at Yaddo, a famous artists’ colony in upstate New York. Capote spent part of the summer of 1946 there, where he did some work on his novel and completed the short story, “The Headless Hawk,” which was published by Mademoiselle that fall.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At Yaddo, Capote fell in love with Newton Arvin, a college professor and literary scholar. The bookish academic and the effervescent charmer made quite an interesting pair. Arvin, as with most of the others at the colony, was completely taken by Capote’s wit, manner, and appearance. That same year, Capote won the prestigious O.

In the book, a young boy is sent to live with his father after the death of his mother. His father’s home is a decrepit old plantation. For a time, the boy doesn’t get to see his father and instead must deal with his stepmother, her cousin, and some other unusual characters that inhabit this desolate place. While some criticized elements of the story, such as its homosexual theme, many reviewers noted Capote’s talents as a writer. The book sold well, especially for a first-time author.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In addition to receiving accolades and publicity, Capote found love again in 1948. He met author Jack Dunphy at a party that year, and the two began a 35-year relationship. During the early years of their relationship, Capote and Dunphy traveled extensively.

Not one to stay out of the public eye for long, his travel essays were put out in book form in 1950 as Local Color.

The fanciful tale explored an unlikely group of characters who take refuge from their troubles in a large tree. At the request of Broadway producer Saint Subber, Capote adapted his novel for the stage. The sets and costumes were designed by Capote’s close friend Cecil Beaton. The comedy opened in March 1952 and ran for 36 performances.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1953, Capote landed some movie work. He wrote some of Stazione Termini (later released as Indiscretion of an American Wife in the United States), which starred Jennifer Jones and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/montgomery-clift data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Montgomery Clift" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Montgomery Clift</a>.

The two traveled to Kansas to interview townspeople, friends and family of the deceased, and the investigators working to solve the crime. Capote, with his flamboyant personality and style, had a hard time initially getting into his subjects’ good graces.

Lee and Capote got a chance to interview the suspects not long after their return in January 1960. Soon after, Lee and Capote went back to New York. Capote started working on his article, which evolved into the nonfiction masterpiece In Cold Blood. He also corresponded with the accused killers, pressing them to reveal more about themselves and the crime. In March 1960, Capote and Lee returned to Kansas for the murder trial.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hickock and Smith were convicted and sentenced to death, but their execution was staved off by a series of appeals. The two hoped Capote would help them escape the hangman’s noose and were upset to hear that the book’s title was In Cold Blood, which indicated that the murders had been premeditated.</p><img alt="a large home sits on a plot of land, two trees without many leaves are in the foreground" title="Clutter family home outside Holcomb, Kansas" width=1993 height=1308 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/clutter-family-home-news-photo-1706288000.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>The Clutter family home outside of Holcomb, Kansas, where Richard Hickock and Perry Smith killed four members of the family</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Writing this nonfiction masterwork took a lot out of Capote. For years, he labored on it and still had to wait for the story to find its ending in the legal system. Hickock and Smith were finally executed on April 14, 1965, at the Kansas State Penitentiary. At their request, Capote traveled to Kansas to witness their deaths. He refused to see them the day before, but he visited with both Hickock and Smith shortly before their hangings.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In Cold Blood became a huge hit, both critically and commercially. Capote used a number of techniques usually found in fiction to bring this true story to life for his readers. It was first serialized in The New Yorker across four issues in 1965 with readers anxiously awaiting each gripping installment. When it was published as a book in 1966, In Cold Blood was an instant best-seller. It became a movie, starring <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/robert-blake data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Robert Blake" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Robert Blake</a> and Scott Wilson, in 1967 and later a TV miniseries.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=47 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Although In Cold Blood brought him acclaim and wealth, Capote was never the same after the project. Digging into such dark territory had taken a toll on him psychologically and physically. Known to drink, Capote began drinking more and started taking tranquilizers to soothe his frayed nerves. His substance abuse problems escalated over the coming years.</p><h2 data-node-id=48 title="Later Work: Answered Prayers Controversy" data-anchor-id=later-work-answered-prayers-controversy class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Later Work: Answered Prayers Controversy</h2><img alt="truman capote dances with a woman as they are surrounded by other couples dancing, everyone wears formal attire in the ballroom" title="Truman Capote dancing at his Black and White Ball, November 1966" width=4500 height=3044 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/american-novelist-short-story-writer-and-playwright-truman-news-photo-1706287368.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Truman Capote dances during his Black and White Ball on November 28, 1966.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=50 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Despite his problems, Capote did manage to pull off one of the biggest social events of the 20th century.
