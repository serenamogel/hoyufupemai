Born in South Porcupine, Ontario, Elizabeth leaves behind a legacy of love and cherished memories that will forever remain in the hearts of her family and friends.&nbsp;Elizabeth’s life was a testament to the values of love, compassion, and kindness. She touched the lives of many with her warm smile and generous spirit, and her memory will continue to be a source of comfort and inspiration to all who were fortunate enough to know her.</p><p>Elizabeth was a loving mother to her children, Christine Colarossi (Frank Colarossi) and David Bordignon (Jackie Bordignon). She was a doting grandmother to Sidney, Amanda, Nellie, and Benjamin, who held a special place in her heart. Her family was her greatest source of joy, and she cherished every moment spent with them.&nbsp;In addition to her family, Elizabeth was surrounded by a close-knit circle of friends who shared in her laughter, joys, and sorrows. She was a cherished friend to Joan, Terry Bachmeier, Mae, John Bonato, Penelope, and Burt Hayes, among others. Their enduring friendships were a testament to the warmth and kindness that Elizabeth brought into the lives of those around her.</p><p>As we come together to remember Elizabeth, let us honor her memory by carrying forward the values she held dear love, compassion, and a genuine spirit of friendship. In our hearts, she will always remain a beacon of light, guiding us through the darkest of days.&nbsp;To Elizabeth’s family and friends, we extend our deepest sympathies during this difficult time. May your cherished memories of Elizabeth bring you solace, and may the love and support of those around you provide comfort in the days ahead.&nbsp;In lieu of flowers, the family kindly requests that donations be made in Elizabeth’s honor to a charity of your choice. As we celebrate her life, let us also pay tribute to her enduring legacy of love and kindness that will continue to shine brightly in our hearts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidpJq%2Fr63Loaanp6Keu6h6wqikaKuRoq6vwMeaZKSZnKCvs7HNp5yrZZ%2BXtrXBwKuwZpldpb%2Bmr8iorKxlo6TCrXnGqKWeZaSkvG6%2FzqilaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lisa-ambalavanar.html><span>←</span><span>Lisa Ambalavanar movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</span></a>
