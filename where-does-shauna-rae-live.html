She hopes to raise awareness about her condition and to make others like her feel more normal.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">E!News</a>, Shauna said, “There’s not a lot of people like me but there are people out there who, like me, just feel different in any way.”</p><p>She continued:</p><p>When the trailer came out, it was kind of like I was worldwide almost overnight. People have reached out to me; I have found other people with pituitary dwarfism, and it’s really not only helped me but helped them because now we know that we’re not alone.</p><p>Check out her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> account here!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by 🎗ЅℋᎯUℕᎯ🐘 (@thereal_shaunarae99)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-shauna-rae-s-net-worth>What is Shauna Rae’s net worth?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">PopularNetWorth</a>, Shauna is said to be worth approximately $100,000.
