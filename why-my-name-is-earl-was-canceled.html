He asks them where they got the idea of making a list, and they tell him that someone came to them with a list, and that person got the idea from someone else. Earl eventually realizes that his idea started a chain reaction of people with lists and that he’s finally put more good into the world than bad.”</p><p dir=ltr>At the time of this writing, no new “My Name is Earl” content is officially in the works. Still, that doesn’t mean it’ll never happen.&nbsp;Series star Jason Lee told JoBlo in 2020 that he’d love to do a limited series to bring Garcia’s finale vision to life, something he said has been discussed among the cast and creators: “But, yeah, that’s definitely on the list, no pun intended, to try to wrap up that universe if we can.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue9OrnKecmaO0cMPHsmSmsV2jrq6xjKKqZp2Rp7luw8CsZJyZnpiyrbHDaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./turtle-pecan-pie-bars.html><span>←</span><span>Turtle Pecan Pie Bars - Mom On Timeout</span></a>
