As astronomer Fred Hoyle explained via <a href=#>Best Life</a>, the boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and space is an arbitrary one, but is generally considered to be about 60 miles up. From there, the math is easy: driving at 60 miles per hour, you could drive to space in one hour.</p><p dir=ltr>Getting to the nearest space "landmark," so to speak, is going to require a bit more effort. The Moon, according to <a href=#>Science Focus</a>, is roughly 250,000 miles away. That means the trip would take 4,166 hours, or nearly 174 days of driving without stopping.</p><p dir=ltr>And finally, and strictly for the sake of reference, there's Earth's celestial neighbor to which we've been sending spacecraft for decades, with a view toward one day sending a manned mission up there: <a href=#>Mars</a>. The Red Planet is 218.7 million miles away, according to <a href=#>NASA</a>. Driving there at 60 miles per hour, it would take over 3.6 million hours to reach Mars. That's 151,875 days, or 415 years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCAknBubHBfqbWqv4yiqmagn6x6rbvNoGSirF2svLa4w2armqOVYsGwecOroK%2BdXam8br%2FPmpqeZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./frank-billingsley-net-worth-income-html.html><span>←</span><span>Frank Billingsley Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
