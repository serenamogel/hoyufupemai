Annyeong (안녕) can also be used to say "Goodbye".<h2>Is it rude to say Annyeong?</h2>It's respectful and can be used in any context, from greeting an employee at a shop to meeting a friend's grandparents. If speaking to a close friend or someone significantly younger, you might use the more informal annyeong (애영).<h2>What does Annyeong Hashimnikka mean?</h2>안녕하십니까 (annyeong hashimnikka) Good evening.

Often, it might happen that before a person responds to your greeting by also saying 'annyeonghaseyo', they say '네' (yes), to answer that they are fine.<h2>Don't say Annyeong haseyo in Korea!
