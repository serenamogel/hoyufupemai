He was married to Annette Cox for over three decades. The former couple even had three children – Kristine, Beau and Danielle Schnatter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/geniuscelebs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/John-Schnatter-ex-wife.jpg><p>The Indiana native has not been in a relationship since divorcing his wife in 2019, which might have made people question his sexual orientation. However, it is safe to say that the entrepreneur’s sexuality is straight.</p><p>Schnatter walked down the aisle with Annette Cox on 11 April 1987 and lived in Anchorage, Kentucky. John’s ex-wife filed for divorce on 5 December 2019.</p><p>Cox disclosed that she had been separated from John for eight months (April 2019). She wrote that the marriage was irretrievably broken.</p><p>As <a href=# rel=noopener>reported by Heavy</a>, John Schnatter’s ex-wife owns a Papa John’s franchise in Louisville. She has been highly involved in the business with her husband and has owned the franchise since the late 1980s.</p><p>While operating under Papa John’s brand name, the Company is registered as Joe K Corporation. It employs fewer than 50 individuals. Moreover, the annual report submitted in June 2019 reveals that the franchise earns nearly $1 million annually.</p><h2>John Schnatter Admired His Wife A Lot</h2><p>John Schnatter and his former wife, Annette, had been together since the early days of Papa Johns’s. The former couple got hitched three years after selling pizza out of the converted broom closet.</p><p>In an interview in 2013, the entrepreneur praised Cox as the finest human being he had ever met. John added that Annette is the best franchise operator in Papa John’s system.

The Schnatter-Cox daughter is a doting mother of two kids with her husband, Evan McWhirter, a real estate agent.</p><h2>Papa John Net Worth And Career</h2><p>As reported by <a href=# rel=noopener>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Papa John Schnatter’s net worth is $400 million.</p><p>The former CEO of Papa John’s became a national celebrity after appearing in a series of national commercials with the signature phrase, “better ingredients. Better Pizza. Papa Johns.”</p><p>Since the founding of Papa John’s pizza in 1984, the Company grew insanely until the early 2010s. John Schnatter’s downfall with the pizza Company began in 2012.</p><p>The entrepreneur publicly criticized the Affordable Care Act. The storm passed shortly. However, another one brewed in 2017 after he blamed NFL openly for his Company’s poor financial performance.</p><p>As a result, John stepped down as CEO in early 2018. He continued to remain chairman of the board until July 2018. After his derogatory remarks on a conference call were made public, he abruptly left the Company in July 2018.</p><p><strong>You Might Like:</strong><a href=#>&nbsp;Aya Nakamura Boyfriend: Explore The Relationship Of the Singer With Her Baby Daddy, Vladimir Boudnikoff</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiflaO2tr%2FCnqOemqNjsLC5jqKqZqiRpa5uts6hpWafka56q7vHp2Ssm5ijrrXAxKtkrJ2oqq6ttdOyZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-old-are-taylor-and-sophia-on-tiktok-explained.html><span>←</span><span>How old are Taylor and Sophia on Tiktok?
