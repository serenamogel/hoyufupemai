Myers is best known for her role in the Netflix series Wednesday,&nbsp;Girl in the Basement, and A Taste of Christmas among others.</strong></p><p>Emma Myers is a fast-rising American actress who started her acting career as a child in 2010. She gained massive public recognition in 2022 with her lead role as Enid Sinclair in Wednesday. Since then, she has remained a subject of attention, gathering numerous fans and lovers, thanks to her unique performance. In this post, we will discuss her movies and TV shows as well as her acting journey so far.</p><h2><strong>Emma Myers’ Acting Journey Took Off in 2010</strong></h2><p>Emma Myers had a passion for acting right from childhood and decided to make a career out of it. Growing up in her hometown of Orlando, Florida, United States, Emma attended a homeschool cooperative. So, she never had an experience of a traditional school but that did not deter her from sustaining the passion she naturally had for acting.</p><p>She has three sisters; Avery, Olivia, and Isabel alongside whom she grew up, and Isabel is also an actress. At a younger age, Emma and her sisters would organize some drama in their house and randomly showcase their acting skills. It seems they were born into a family that has inborn acting skills.</p><p>At the age of 8, in 2010, Emma Myers landed her first acting role in the American crime drama television series, The Glades. In the same year, she appeared in two movies, Letters to God and Crooked. Although Emma played just minor roles in the mentioned movies and series, her performance established the fact that she was a born actress.</p><h2><strong>She Started Her Professional Acting Career at Age 16</strong></h2><p>Emma Myers started acting professionally at the age of 16. After starring in The Glades, Letters to God, and Crooked, the child actress went back to fully concentrate on her education and did not get any acting role again until 2019. Upon her return to the industry, Myers was then very ready to show the entirety of the talent she’s got.</p><p>The first professional role she landed was in Love, Innocence (2019). In the following year, she appeared as Stephanie in the series, The Baker and the Beauty and the film,&nbsp;Deathless. In 2020, she starred in the TV series Dead Night and A Taste of Christmas. Her outstanding performances in the above-named movies and television series paved the way for her to get more roles in other successful projects which introduced her to public knowledge.</p><h2><strong>Emma Myers Got Her Breakthrough With Her Role on Wednesday</strong></h2><p>Myers came into the limelight as an actress after she featured as Marie Cody in the 2021 TV series, Girl in Basement. Yet, her big break ultimately came in 2022 with her role in the famous Netflix series&nbsp;Wednesday, which was her first time starring in a Netflix series. Myers played the role of Enid Sinclair and her character was well-received by the viewing audience.</p><p>In the series, Emma was opportune to share screens with notable actors like Gwendoline Christie, Jenna Ortega, Riki Lindhome, Georgie Farmer, Percy Hynes White, and others. Wednesday follows the story of the character Wednesday Addams portrayed by Jenna Ortega who was expelled from her school after she dumped live piranhas into the school’s pool.</p><p>Emma’s character Enid Sinclair plays Wednesday’s roommate. The direct opposite of Wednesday Addams, Enid is a teenage werewolf who is passionate about colors and does everything she can to become Wednesday’s friend. At first, Wednesday wasn’t interested but later gave in and they would eventually become besties.</p><p>The Wednesday series so far has 8 episodes and Emma Myers stars in all of them. It was released on 23rd November 2020 and still airs to date. The series has received multiple accolades and great reviews from viewers and critics, won a good number of awards, and got nominated for many. Some of which include Best Horror Series and Favorite Family TV Show.</p><p>Wednesday has, in no doubt, introduced Emma Myers to a large audience, established her in the limelight, earned her significantly more fans and followers across her various social media platforms, and ultimately remained her big break yet.</p><h2><strong>What Movies are Emma Myers Most Famous For?</strong></h2><p>As we have also mentioned earlier, Emma Myers is mostly known for Wednesday, Crooked, Girl in the Basement and A Taste of Christmas, and Letters to God.
