<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>The Railway Man movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2014)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>What’s not surprising is the subtlety <a href=#>Colin Firth</a> finds in playing <a href=#>Eric Lomax</a>, whose autobiography inspired "The Railway Man." (<a href=#>Frank Cottrell Boyce</a> and <a href=#>Andy Paterson</a> co-wrote the screenplay.) Playing Lomax as a shell of his former self decades after his imprisonment, Firth is both quietly distracted and fitfully tormented. Throughout his career, Firth repeatedly has proven himself to be a master at steadily revealing his characters, and the way his Lomax eventually reclaims his identity before enjoying some redemption is gently stirring.</p><p>Lomax also finds some fleeting moments of tentative joy with the love of his life, whom he encounters in middle age: his wife, Patti, played by <a href=#>Nicole Kidman</a> in an underwritten role. Kidman is kind of charming at first as she flirts with and falls for Firth. But in no time, she’s relegated to serving as the teary-eyed wife, listening to what happened to her husband and whispering responses of shock and sadness.</p><p>In the annoying framing device that flashes back and forth in time far too frequently, we see Lomax and Patti meet cute on a train. The year is 1980 in Northern England. He is nerdy, tweedy, hurried. She is prim, sharp, poised. He’s an expert on trains—an "enthusiast," to use his word. She’s a former nurse. Both are in flux and clearly a little fragile. As they wind their way along the English and Scottish coast, he drops little tidbits about various train lines and trivia on the towns that blur past them. She’s chatty and charming in response.</p><p>"Don’t move," Lomax says as Patti stands in his cramped kitchen on her first visit to his apartment. "Why not?" she asks. "’Cause I’m looking at you."</p><p>Individually lonely, alone and adrift, they fall in love and get married in no time. But on what should be the happiest day of his life, Lomax is haunted by nightmarish memories of the brutality he endured as a POW—a condition we now know as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. It’s not something he and the other veterans at the Officers Club, including his close friend and fellow ex-prisoner Finlay (<a href=#>Stellan Skarsgard</a>), ever talk about.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lopa2rcPAsmSmmZ5if3F9kw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shalane-mccall-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-666475-html.html><span>←</span><span>Shalane McCall Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
