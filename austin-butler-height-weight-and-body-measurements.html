The late singer rose to the limelight to become one of the most influential musicians of his time. His prowess in rock and roll earned him the nickname “King of Rock and Roll.”</p><p>There were so many factors that made Austin the best fit for the role of Elvis in the film, which included his height.

However, he&nbsp;got out of the audition even before it got to the final stage.</p><p><span>The Nowhere Boy star’s height would have been a perfect fit for the role, given that he stands at 5 feet, 10½ inches.
