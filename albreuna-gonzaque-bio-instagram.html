I am ready to embrace this next chapter of life and all that it may bring!”</strong></span></p><p><span>When Albruena joined her fellow contestants at Miss USA 2021 for Tulsa tour she expressed she felt like one of the hosts and shared, <strong>“It’s been wonderful taking my sisters around. I think they’re soaking it up. It’s really important that we learn the truth of our history, and I’m so glad Tulsa could be a place for us to do that. It’s just so powerful walking through those exhibits and feeling the emotions they bring out.” Miss Oklahoma 2021 added, “It’s tragic but also uplifting because you understand how far we’ve come.”</strong></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6CzZpOkunDA0Z6lnaGenHyiuMGrnK6mkWK0sLrZmqiunV2XtrB5yKeqrZmXp66u</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tom-reffner-death-obituary-family.html><span>←</span><span>Rudolph Tom Reffner Death And Obituary: Family Mourns</span></a>
