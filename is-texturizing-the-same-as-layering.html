Most texturizer products include a few key ingredients to help condition and restore the hair. However, it is important to remember that a chemical treatment, no matter how 'lite' is still a chemical treatment.<h2>How long should you wait to Texturize your hair again?</h2>You can expect a texturizer for natural hair to last from eight to 10 weeks. After that period, your hair will revert to its natural state, so you'll need to repeat the treatment to maintain the look. Keep in mind, some people like to wait even longer than two months to get a touch-up.<h2>Is texturizer good for natural hair?</h2>Despite what some products may claim, texturizers are not "natural." This is still a chemical process and it can damage your hair or lead to overprocessing.<h2>Does thin hair look thicker with layers?</h2>Layered and textured waves make the hair look wider, Tesler says, which gives the illusion that you have fuller hair than you do.<h2>What is the difference between layered and feathered hair?</h2>A layer cut involves cutting different lengths throughout your hair. This style results in more volume, lighter tresses, and shorter dry time. As noted, layers are one of the features of a feather haircut.

Short layers don't mean that your top layer is short in length. ...</li><li>ask your hairstylist to help you decide where the layers should go. Around your face? ...</li><li>I like to point cut when I do subtle/short layers but each stylist will do it differently.</li><h2>Should thin hair be layered?</h2>While normal layers can have the effect of making hair look thinner—a definite no-no for those of us with already thin strands—interior or invisible layers work to create texture and fullness.

Cut-happy stylists that can't put down the thinning shears are a serious danger. Curly hair needs weight removed from its bulk, but the weight should never be removed from the ends. Curly hair needs the ends to be heavy so the curl can take shape.<h2>Can I tell barber to texture my hair?</h2>For no transition, ask for a shaved part (long on top, buzzed on the sides).
