The Rock — who was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed</a> by Foxx 5 years ago for Thrillist — commented, “I’m gonna bear hug the [expletive] outta you when I see you again 🐻 ❤️”</p><p data-characters=155 data-current-count=155 data-injectable=false>Day Shift co-star and Real Housewife Kandi Burruss offered a sweet, “I am sooooo glad to see you smile!

We certainly hope that he continues to recover, and that he will be back on our screens soon. His latest forays — God is a Bullet (available for rent on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube</a>), Strays (releases on August 18), and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">They Cloned Tyrone</a> (came out a week ago on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a> and receiving acclaim) — will keep us entertained in the meantime.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqrjLZqqmoaSderW0xGapqJubYre2v9OipWasmaKvpr7LmqKeZZGjsW6706Gcq6tdmLWmsdFmoZqlmZp6p7vXsWSopl2WwG60xGacppqRp7i0ec6nZKunkZl6tbuMq5ycp6aav7p7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./r-j-bell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><span>←</span><span>R.J.
