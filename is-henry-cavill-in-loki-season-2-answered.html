Answered</h1></header><section class=post-content><p data-characters=301 data-injectable=true data-video=true>With the Man of Steel long in his rearview mirror and his tenure as Geralt of Rivia in Netflix’s The Witcher behind him, some may be wondering: will <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Henry Cavill</a></strong> join Marvel next? In particular, there was a certain amount of interest in seeing the Justice League giant drop by in Loki season 2.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=482 data-current-count=482 data-injectable=true>Though we certainly would love to see Cavill make his Marvel Cinematic Universe debut, given how much he’s been jerked around by DC, the idea was certainly a pie-in-the-sky one. Nevertheless, hopes are difficult to dash so some may have been waiting patiently week by week, as each new episode of Loki dropped, to see if Cavill could show up. With all six episodes now streaming on Disney Plus, however, here’s the definitive answer on if Henry stops by the TVA or not.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Who was Henry Cavill rumored to play in Loki season 2?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Marvel-Hyperion.jpg><p data-characters=469 data-current-count=769 data-injectable=true>For whatever reason, speculation reached intense levels at the tail-end of 2022 that Henry Cavill would feature in Loki season 2 as none other than Hyperion. The character has long been a popular choice for a potential Marvel role for Cavill as he is very much one of Marvel’s Superman analogue characters. One of the Eternals, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hyperion has all the usual Superman-like powers</a> and is a member of the Squadron Supreme (a thinly veiled clone of the Justice League).</p><p data-characters=479 data-current-count=479 data-injectable=true>The rumors reached such a peak, in fact, that Cavill himself had to play them down in an interview from October 2022, with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the actor remarking</a>: “<strong>As far as I know, I am not going to be in Loki. It would be a tricky one to handle at this stage.</strong>” However, Cavill then gave us a ray of renewed hope when he teased that he could always follow in the footsteps of famous franchise two-timer James Gunn when he added, <strong>“If James Gunn can do it, maybe I can too.”</strong></p><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=220 data-injectable=false>He said no, then, but it wasn’t exactly a hard no, so naturally this only fed the thinking that he could be pulling an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Andrew “I’m Not The Werewolf” Garfield</a> here. But is Cavill in Loki season 2?</p><h2 id=h-does-henry-cavill-appear-in-loki-season-2 data-injectable=false>Does Henry Cavill appear in Loki season 2?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Loki-season-2-episode-5-1.jpg><p data-characters=327 data-current-count=327 data-injectable=false>I’m sorry to break it to you, guys, but no, Henry Cavill is not in Loki season 2. Not for a brief cameo, not even for an audible-only role like Mahershala Ali in the Eternals post-credits scene. It turns out that sometimes actors are telling the truth when they deny being in a Marvel project. Who’d have thunk it?</p><p data-characters=438 data-current-count=765 data-injectable=false>Nevertheless, history has shown us that sometimes, just sometimes, if we wish upon a star and a blue fairy appears, Marvel fancasts can be made real. Just see John Krasinski becoming (a) Mr. Fantastic in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. So even if there was no hint of Henry in Loki, we still can’t entirely rule out the possibility of him joining the MCU as the Multiverse Saga deepens. Let the Hyperion hype continue!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yqv4yhnKeqqWKwosLIpaNmoZ5iubC3yGaqnpmjpLtufoyapayvlaeypXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./favorite-healthy-recipes.html><span>←</span><span>My favorite healthy recipes</span></a>
