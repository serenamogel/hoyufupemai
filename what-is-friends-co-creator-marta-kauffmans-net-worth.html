As a producer on Friends, a show that basically will be shown in reruns forever on TV and streamed by basically everyone forever, Kauffman is entitled to the residuals from the show. With a show that popular, it’s no wonder she’s worth so much.</p><p data-characters=361 data-current-count=702 data-injectable=true>Don’t just assume Friends was her only major success though. Her first major sitcom success came from being a writer, producer, co-executive producer, creative consultant, and the creator of Dream On, which ran from 1990 to 1996, and was syndicated by Comedy Central, so it kept airing all the way until 1999 —though it isn’t available to stream.</p><p data-characters=441 data-current-count=441 data-injectable=true>This wasn’t the first time something like this would happen for Marta, either. She created Veronica’s Closet, which released originally in 1997 but was so massively popular it would be shown as reruns on various channels all the way through 2012. She just kept on co-creating incredibly popular sitcoms with the multiple award winning Grace and Frankie, though the residuals from that show in particular <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">might be pretty pathetic</a>.</p><p data-characters=167 data-current-count=167 data-injectable=false>It’s not just television where Kauffman has shown her producer prowess, either, as she’s shown her talent on Broadway, working on the Beetlejuice musical.</p><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=462 data-injectable=true>Kauffman even has made some of her money in real estate, selling two different homes over the years for $8 million and $6.37 respectively. Her current oceanfront Malibu mansion cost $2.7 million to buy, not including the house right next door, which she also eventually bought for $23.6 million.</p><p data-characters=222 data-current-count=222 data-injectable=false>To put this in perspective, she’s worth more than Friends stars <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lisa Kudrow</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cortney Cox</a> combined. Big name actors may get some serious fame, but maybe producing and creating shows is where the money is really at.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZKKrXZu%2FqrHNnapmm59isLOxwK2mq2Wdlr%2B1rYykmK6elqKur7%2BMp5ytZaekv7W0jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tahini-noodles-roasted-carrots-chickpeas.html><span>←</span><span>Tahini Noodle Salad with Carrots &amp;amp; Chickpeas</span></a>
