<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Cars 2 movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2011)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>At one point, in a shot so brief you don't want to blink, we even learn that the Popemobile travels in its own Popemobile. This inspires the theological puzzle of whether the one inside is the pope. One of my fellow viewers said she didn't even see a Popemobile. Maybe I dreamed it. In any event, there are no humans in the movie who could be the pope, although much is made of the dinosaurs who are a source of fossil fuels. Actually, I believe oil originated from ancient plants and microorganisms and not so much from dinosaurs, but in the Lasseter universe, it no doubt comes from gas-guzzling dinosaurs like in those old Rambler ads.</p><p>But I digress. Lightning McQueen ends up in a championship duel with the Italian driver Francesco Bernoulli (<a href=#>John Turturro</a> at full throttle). He and Mater find themselves in the middle of a clandestine war between the forces of fossil and alternative fuels, also involving the British secret agents Finn McMissile (<a href=#>Michael Caine</a>) and Holley Shiftwell (<a href=#>Emily Mortimer</a>). Having recently admired <a href=#>Steve Coogan</a> and <a href=#>Rob Brydon</a> doing dueling Michael Caine imitations in "<a href=#>The Trip</a>," I noted that Michael Caine does a pretty good one himself.</p><p>The original film was an elegy to a past when America spun out along Route 66 and now-classic cars occupied an iconic role in American lives. The cars in "Cars 2" have developed an array of new bells and whistles; they extrude so many wires, spikes, weapons and gimmicks they must really be shape-shifters, and Mater in particular is expert at disguising himself. This is not surprising, because a lot of the guys you find around tow trucks are pretty good at using paint jobs to dress up beaters.</p><p>Anyway, "Cars 2" is fun. Whether that's because John Lasseter is in touch with his inner child or mine, I cannot say. There remains one bone to pick. Although the hero of the 2006 film was a Hudson with the step-down design and there are AMC Gremlins in this film, as nearly as I can tell, Lasseter entirely ignores the greatest independent American automaker of them all, Studebaker. Maybe I missed one. I don't think so. There is a more obvious reason. Introducing a Studebaker Golden Hawk into this film would make all of the other characters look shabby.</p><p><i>Note: The 3-D adds nothing and darkens the bright colors.
