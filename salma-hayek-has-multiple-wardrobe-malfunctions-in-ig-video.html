Recommended Videos Why the delight? You can likely deduce what delighted fans from the words “wardrobe malfunction.” Salma was dancing around with a friend in what appeared to be a video of a photo shoot, though no one can be blamed for falsely assuming it was a scene from Magic Mike’s Last Dance that she recently co-starred in."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Though that movie series can be described as intentional wardrobe malfunctions of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Channing Tatum</a>, this one of Hayek had fans experiencing a different kind of magic. Salma’s excuse for posting it was to celebrate hitting the 24 million followers mark on IG. Coincidentally, I also plan on bouncing around in a bathrobe when I reach the 24 million followers mark.</p><p data-characters=187 data-current-count=187 data-injectable=false>However, it begs the question: Why the frustration? Not about my intended celebration but about why fans were frustrated to see Salma so sweetly celebrating something so socially special.</p><p data-characters=44 data-current-count=231 data-injectable=false>Well, because it was all just a booby trap.</p><p data-characters=148 data-current-count=379 data-injectable=false>During the parts where her parts found freedom, those parts were also blurred out. Such an edit had the comments filled with jokes about censorship.</p><p data-characters=158 data-current-count=537 data-injectable=true>The most popular replies were, “Is there an uncensored version. Asking for a friend,” and a reply that similarly asked, “Where’s the uncut version.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/C610C75F-FD90-4AB3-9143-A3197343717C.jpeg><p data-characters=52 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false>Another popular reply was, “ I hate censorship.”</p><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=669 data-injectable=true>Salma kept popping out of her bathrobe that would also slightly open near her waist, resulting in more blurriness that censored another part of her body. At this point, it’s uncertain why Salma didn’t just post a nude photo with one large blur. Maybe that will be when she celebrates having 25 million followers.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TAorjMmmShmamauG60wKxkpq2cqbaxuMRmrpqqlKe8o7GMppilnqWjsLW1zqeqZqGeYraoedWim56nXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-common-are-botflies-in-humans.html><span>←</span><span>How common are botflies in humans?</span></a>
