The character’s timeless appeal was a testament to Roundtree’s acting prowess and his contribution to changing the face of cinema.</p><p>Outside of ‘Shaft,’ Roundtree had a versatile career that spanned both television and film. He appeared in several notable projects, such as the television series ‘Roots,’ where he played the character of Sam Bennett. He was also recognized for his work in movies like ‘Man Friday’ and ‘Se7en.’</p><p>Richard Roundtree was not only a remarkable actor but also a respected figure in the African American community.
